# Reading Questions

Tsai, Lily L. 2007. "Solidary Groups, Informal Accountability, and Local Public Goods Provision in Rural China." *American Political Science Review 101*(2): 355-372. 

Consider the following questions:

 - Why is (local) public/governmental goods provision an important topic to study?

 - Why is public goods provision a collective action problem? What is the problem of accountability? How can solidary groups contribute to “informal” accountability?

 - What is the scope condition? Namely, by focusing on rural China, what is the larger set of comparable cases Tsai seeks to speak to?

 - Is Tsai’s question/theory generalizable? Or is it specific to rural China? Why or why not? If yes, can you think of any other cases? Can you find a different case to test the observable implications of her theory? What is a case?
