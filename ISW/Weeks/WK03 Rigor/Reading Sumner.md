# Questions to Think About

Sumner, Andy, and Michael Tribe. 2004. "The Nature of Epistemology and Methodology in Development Studies: What Do We Mean by 'Rigour'?" Paper for DSA Annual Conference.

When you read Sumner and Tribe, think through the following questions:

 - Do you agree with the distinction between positivism and constructivism? Does your research fall into one of these epistemological positions?

 - Do you agree with the alignment between epistemological positions and the choice of methods?

 - Is such alignment always the case? Can we be somewhere in between? 

 - How do we know when a research work is rigorous?
