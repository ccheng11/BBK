Dear Jacob,

Welcome to Birkbeck -- I am writing to you as the Interim Director of BA Social and Political Sciences.  

As your program director, I am here to help you navigate your study at Birkbeck.  You might also find this book useful: https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691179537/will-this-be-on-the-test.  I have enclosed an excerpt of the book for your reference.

More importantly, all incoming undergraduate students in Politics invited to attend the induction on Wednesday 24th September.  It would be a great opportunity to to meet your classmates (and your professors).  We will explain in the induction a few important things for the coming academic year.

We will meet at Room 541, Malet Street (Birkbeck's main building), at 6pm.  The induction is followed by a reception with all undergraduate students in the School of Social Sciences.

Congratulations on your offer again!  I look forward to meeting you.

Best,
Chao-yo
