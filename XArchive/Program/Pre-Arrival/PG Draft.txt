Dear MRes/MSc Social Research and MRes Politics students,

I hope you had a wonderful summer -- as we gear up for the new academic year, Term 1 kicks off on 1st October (see term dates here).

https://www.bbk.ac.uk/about-us/term-dates

Just a few quick reminders to help you prepare.  Please be sure to keep all our email correspondences handy, as they contain important information.  And as always, feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

To all MRes Politics students: I am serving as your Interim Director as Dr Barry Maydom is on leave in Autumn 2024.

Enrollment

If you havenâ€™t already, please complete the enrollment process as soon as possible.  Reach out to Student Services or me if you have any questions.

https://www.bbk.ac.uk/student-services/admissions/enrolment

Module selection

We have finished the first round of module selection in mid-August.  It was great to speak to some of you during the drop-in sessions.

If you have submitted your choices, you will see your choices on My Birkbeck in due course -- please bear with us for the possible delay as Birkbeck is still recovering from a recent IT incident.

If you still need to the module information sheets and submit your choices, please contact our program administration team at fhss-edu-sss@bbk.ac.uk.

If you would like to discuss your module choices, please contact me.

Office hours

My regular Friday office hours will resume, starting next week.  Please note you may need your Birkbeck login to access the link to make an appointment.

I encourage you to use office hours to discuss any questions with me.  As your program director and personal tutor, I am here as your initial contact point if you are unsure who to reach out to.

You are also welcome to email me to set up an appointment. By default, all office hour meetings will be held online via Microsoft Teams.

Induction and reception

All incoming and continuing MRes/MSc Social Research and MRes Politics students are invited to attend the induction on Wednesday, 25th September!

This is a great opportunity to meet your classmates and learn about important aspects of the upcoming academic year, including the dissertation process.

We will meet at 6pm in Room 255, Malet Street (Birkbeck's main building).  The induction will be followed by a reception with all postgraduate students from the School of Social Sciences.

Preparatory readings

Attached, you will find the preparatory readings for this academic year -- I hope you find them helpful.  We will be able to discuss some of them in different modules.

I look forward to seeing you -- once again, welcome to Birkbeck!

Best,
Chao-yo
