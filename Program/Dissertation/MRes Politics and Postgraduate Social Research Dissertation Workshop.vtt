00:03:21.424 --> 00:03:26.014
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Dissertation is basically an

00:03:26.014 --> 00:03:30.293

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:34.105
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>I put supervisors here as a

00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:39.108
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>In many cases, and this is one
of the one of the special things</v>

00:03:39.108 --> 00:03:41.065
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>about social researcher
students.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/527-0
00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:45.376
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Instead of giving you just one
supervisor under some</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/527-1
00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:49.530
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>circumstances, you may have two
supervisors in the case that,</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/527-2
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.617
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>for instance, you know one of

00:03:53.617 --> 00:03:57.771
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Social Research and the gender

00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:01.724
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>particular student, she needs a
supervisor from gender and</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/527-5
00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:05.342
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>sexuality to help her with

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/527-6
00:04:05.342 --> 00:04:09.228
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>review. But at the same time,
because she's going to do a</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/527-7
00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:11.305
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>survey or experimental project.</v>

00:04:11.775 --> 00:04:15.974
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>And she needs another supervisor
like me or Barry or lost law to</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/579-1
00:04:15.974 --> 00:04:19.850
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>help her with the empirical
analysis or research design. So</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/579-2
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.855
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>that's why it's really common
for Social Research students to</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/579-3
00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:27.989
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>have more than one supervisor,
which is really unusual compared</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/579-4
00:04:27.989 --> 00:04:32.123
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>with other MSA students. But at
the same time, even if you only</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/579-5
00:04:32.123 --> 00:04:33.415
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>have one supervisor.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/592-0
00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:40.113
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Me Chao. I will serve as your

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.025
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>supervisor by default.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/646-0
00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:46.648
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Even though it's not on paper.
OK, so at dissertation. Well,</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/646-1
00:04:46.648 --> 00:04:50.644
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>some students will think you're
trying to write a book, but</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/646-2
00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:54.173
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>you're not writing a book.
You're actually writing a</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/646-3
00:04:54.173 --> 00:04:58.036
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>research article. And the
research article will be really</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/646-4
00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:02.232
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>similar to the journal articles
you have been reading for your</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/646-5
00:05:02.232 --> 00:05:06.228
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>modules, and you're going to
write somewhere between 12,000</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/646-6
00:05:06.228 --> 00:05:09.025
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>and 15,000 words, excluding

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/666-0
00:05:09.905 --> 00:05:12.978
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>So I would say when you're
trying to think about, you know,</v>

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:16.204

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:21.817
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Take it like a. You're writing a

00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:30.223
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>like you're writing a research

00:16:21.295 --> 00:16:24.978
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>just to focus on their writing
for instance, you can say, OK,</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/2096-4
00:16:24.978 --> 00:16:28.185
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>for these two weeks I want to

00:16:32.888 --> 00:16:37.130
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>and you move on to finish your

00:16:41.441 --> 00:16:45.477
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>easy, right? Because the process
should not that difficult</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/2133-4
00:16:45.477 --> 00:16:46.435

00:16:48.225 --> 00:16:50.791
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Should not be that difficult.
It's actually very</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/2199-1
00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:53.880
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>straightforward. But we do

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:03.253
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>to the research process. So we

00:18:06.143 --> 00:18:10.902
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>I'll be happy to provide verbal

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/2311-5
00:18:10.902 --> 00:18:14.695

00:26:34.435 --> 00:26:38.630
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>So about two decades after the
end of the World War, two, a lot</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3384-1
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:42.694
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>of scholars really care. You
know, they're really positive by</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3384-2
00:26:42.694 --> 00:26:46.955
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>revolutions because, you know, a
lot of country became communist</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3384-3
00:26:46.955 --> 00:26:50.691
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>countries. They're going
through, you know, what some of</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3384-4
00:26:50.691 --> 00:26:54.755
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>the they can go through some of
the very violent revolutions.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3384-5
00:26:54.755 --> 00:26:58.687
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Right. So a lot of scholars
start asking, you know, how how</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3384-6
00:26:58.687 --> 00:27:00.195
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>did revolutions happen?</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3403-0
00:27:00.975 --> 00:27:04.606
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>So you can just ask a really big
question and focus on case and</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3403-1
00:27:04.606 --> 00:27:07.215
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>then maybe use case study or
process tracing.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3437-0
00:27:07.735 --> 00:27:12.803
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>And this is something we call
developmental puzzle. You want</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3437-1
00:27:12.803 --> 00:27:16.957
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>to know how a particular
political and social and</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3437-2
00:27:16.957 --> 00:27:21.941
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>economic phenomena happen or
develop or unfold? OK. And the</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3437-3
00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:25.015
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>next thing you can say, OK, so
when?</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3484-0
00:27:27.785 --> 00:27:31.962
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Supposed we know. OK, how
revolutions happen. Maybe one</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3484-1
00:27:31.962 --> 00:27:36.886
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>additional question they can ask
is, you know, just for instance,</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3484-2
00:27:36.886 --> 00:27:41.436
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>if this particular revolution
leads to a democracy, how does</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3484-3
00:27:41.436 --> 00:27:45.464
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>revolution create a democracy?
What is the underlying</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3484-4
00:27:45.464 --> 00:27:50.089
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>mechanisms of dynamics? Maybe
the dynamics involving a lot of</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3484-5
00:27:50.089 --> 00:27:52.625
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>different socio economic
classes?</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3509-0
00:27:53.415 --> 00:27:56.365
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>The mechanism involve a lot of,
you know, strategic interaction</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3509-1
00:27:56.365 --> 00:27:59.361
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>between political leaves, civil
society, civil society, all this</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3509-2
00:27:59.361 --> 00:28:01.942
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>kind of thing. OK, this is
something we call mechanical</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3509-3
00:28:01.942 --> 00:28:02.495
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>puzzles, OK?</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3522-0
00:28:03.965 --> 00:28:07.180
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>So sometimes the distinction
between developmental puzzle and</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3522-1
00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.165
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>mechanical puzzles.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3582-0
00:28:09.975 --> 00:28:13.061
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Is not very clear and usually
you know if you ask a</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3582-1
00:28:13.061 --> 00:28:16.681
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>developmental question. Usually
you also have to address the</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3582-2
00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:20.182
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>question of mechanisms. For
instance, OK, if we go back to</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3582-3
00:28:20.182 --> 00:28:23.624
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>the case of revolution, then
French Revolution or Chinese</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3582-4
00:28:23.624 --> 00:28:27.065
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Communist revolution are
probably some of the most famous</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3582-5
00:28:27.065 --> 00:28:30.685
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>revolutions we know in human
history. That of course we want</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3582-6
00:28:30.685 --> 00:28:33.415
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>to know how did these two
revolutions happen.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3643-0
00:28:33.955 --> 00:28:38.139
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Right. And then we want to know
why? Why did this revolutions</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3643-1
00:28:38.139 --> 00:28:42.457
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>end out the way they they were
right. For instance, in the case</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3643-2
00:28:42.457 --> 00:28:46.438
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>of French Revolution, we know
eventually there's Napoleon,</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3643-3
00:28:46.438 --> 00:28:50.487
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>which is probably not quite
right. According to our current</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3643-4
00:28:50.487 --> 00:28:54.131
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>understanding of modern
democracy. And in the case of</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3643-5
00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:58.314
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>China, the Chinese Communist
revolution, obviously, you know,</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3643-6
00:28:58.314 --> 00:29:02.363
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>created a communist regime or
one of the most long standing</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3643-7
00:29:02.363 --> 00:29:03.915
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>hegemonic party regime.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3693-0
00:29:04.115 --> 00:29:08.010
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>OK, so which which comes to my
next point, you know, in</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3693-1
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:12.113
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>addition to developmental and
mechanical question, you can</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3693-2
00:29:12.113 --> 00:29:16.703
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>also try to ask your question in
a comparative way. For instance,</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3693-3
00:29:16.703 --> 00:29:21.084
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>going back to revolutions, one
of one of the most recent books</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3693-4
00:29:21.084 --> 00:29:25.535
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>in comparative politics, ask the
following question. There have</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3693-5
00:29:25.535 --> 00:29:28.595
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>been a lot of revolutions in
human history.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3706-0
00:29:29.375 --> 00:29:32.694
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>But sometimes revolutions can
create a democracy. Sometimes</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3706-1
00:29:32.694 --> 00:29:34.575
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>revolutions can create
autocracy.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3764-0
00:29:35.675 --> 00:29:39.793
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Why? OK, this is also a very
interesting question, obviously</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3764-1
00:29:39.793 --> 00:29:44.248
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>also very important question and
you can also say, OK, there have</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3764-2
00:29:44.248 --> 00:29:47.691
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>been many democracies in the
world. You know, some</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3764-3
00:29:47.691 --> 00:29:51.809
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>democracies seems to be doing
OK. Some democracies have been</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3764-4
00:29:51.809 --> 00:29:56.197
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>us seem to be OK because either
because the political leaders in</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3764-5
00:29:56.197 --> 00:30:00.450
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>these democracies are trying to
undermine democracy or because</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3764-6
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.395
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>our democracy.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3771-0
00:30:02.175 --> 00:30:05.782
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Is not sustainable in this
country because the the society</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3771-1
00:30:05.782 --> 00:30:06.455
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>has become.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3822-0
00:30:07.325 --> 00:30:11.546
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>And that people don't really
trust the elections, and the</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3822-1
00:30:11.546 --> 00:30:15.984
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>people don't really trust on
democracy as the best system in</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3822-2
00:30:15.984 --> 00:30:20.787
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>town according to, you know, the
terminology by Evan Swansky. And</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3822-3
00:30:20.787 --> 00:30:25.444
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>finally, you can also try to ask
a causal puzzle. For instance,</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3822-4
00:30:25.444 --> 00:30:29.447
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>some people will say OK
Revolution's happening because</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3822-5
00:30:29.447 --> 00:30:33.085
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>for some societies, there is a
really high level.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3834-0
00:30:33.595 --> 00:30:38.506
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Of income inequality, then you
have to answer two questions.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3834-1
00:30:38.506 --> 00:30:40.035
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>For instance first.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3840-0
00:30:43.365 --> 00:30:46.005
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Does high level of income
inequality?</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3886-0
00:30:47.685 --> 00:30:51.418
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Really lead to or increase the
likelihood of revolutions?</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3886-1
00:30:51.418 --> 00:30:55.214
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Maybe. Maybe, maybe yes, maybe
not. You have to answer the</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3886-2
00:30:55.214 --> 00:30:59.333
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>question, and they usually, you
know, only after you answer the</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3886-3
00:30:59.333 --> 00:31:03.130
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>cause of questioning. You know
you also have to answer the</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3886-4
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:06.605
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>mechanical part, which is how
does income inequality.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3943-0
00:31:07.225 --> 00:31:11.118
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Really, really, really increase
the chance of revolutions. So</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3943-1
00:31:11.118 --> 00:31:14.822
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>when people are trying to deal
with coalesposals, they are</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3943-2
00:31:14.822 --> 00:31:18.715
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>usually also trying to answer
mechanical puzzles. OK, so this</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3943-3
00:31:18.715 --> 00:31:22.357
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>is a really quick question and
obviously I know, you know</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3943-4
00:31:22.357 --> 00:31:25.748
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>students are working in
different subject areas. So I</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3943-5
00:31:25.748 --> 00:31:29.829
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>would say if you want to have a

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3943-6
00:31:29.829 --> 00:31:33.345

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3956-0
00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:37.290
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>And this is kind of like the
type one of the technology we</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/3956-1
00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:38.685

00:31:39.305 --> 00:31:42.983

00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:37.800

00:33:54.074 --> 00:33:57.937

00:34:01.455 --> 00:34:05.840
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>So maybe some people were like,

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.609

00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:14.763

00:34:14.763 --> 00:34:19.609

00:34:32.865 --> 00:34:36.479
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>For instance, you know it's
kinda like the dictator has a</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4340-1
00:34:36.479 --> 00:34:40.279

00:34:40.279 --> 00:34:43.145
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>his country becomes a democracy.
OK, however.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4371-0
00:34:44.745 --> 00:34:47.933
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>There was a recent paper by

00:34:47.933 --> 00:34:51.239
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Basically, he went back to a lot

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:54.545
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>democratic transition and

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4390-0
00:34:57.145 --> 00:35:01.836

00:35:01.836 --> 00:35:06.148
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>many cases of democratic

00:35:09.925 --> 00:35:13.423
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>So which means we should not

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4446-1
00:35:13.423 --> 00:35:17.213

00:35:20.244 --> 00:35:23.626
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Democrats just happen because it

00:35:23.626 --> 00:35:27.415

00:35:27.415 --> 00:35:31.205
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>is one of the ways to to justify

00:35:32.745 --> 00:35:37.034
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>And sometimes you can also say,

00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:41.112

<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>There has been a long discussion

00:35:53.883 --> 00:35:57.428
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>basically we're trying to

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:20.884
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>part in the process transition
to also try to interview that</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4699-2
00:37:20.884 --> 00:37:24.774
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>right. So this is one of the
example of where you say OK, I</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4699-3
00:37:24.774 --> 00:37:28.404
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>want to the reason why my
research is important because</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4699-4
00:37:28.404 --> 00:37:32.423
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>I'm using a different empirical
method that other people have</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4699-5
00:37:32.423 --> 00:37:33.655
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>not used very much.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4729-0
00:37:35.755 --> 00:37:39.327
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>And next you can also try to
justify the importance of</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4729-1
00:37:39.327 --> 00:37:43.353
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>research by saying my research
is new because it extends to a</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4729-2
00:37:43.353 --> 00:37:46.795
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>new historical period, it
extends to a new case. OK.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4767-0
00:37:48.345 --> 00:37:53.091
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>And finally, this is kind of one
of the you know like one of the</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4767-1
00:37:53.091 --> 00:37:57.180
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>research I like most. Some

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4767-2
00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.633
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>untested conventional wisdom.
For instance, for a long time,</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4767-3
00:38:01.633 --> 00:38:05.065
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>people say, OK, democracy is
really important.</v>

00:38:05.575 --> 00:38:08.577
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>We should defend democracy and
the democracy is all about free</v>

This kind of thing. You guys</v>

00:38:14.532 --> 00:38:16.295
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>know the argument I'm talking
about.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4796-0
00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:17.985

00:38:19.265 --> 00:38:23.138
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Here's the thing, on the one

00:38:23.138 --> 00:38:26.872

00:38:26.872 --> 00:38:31.159
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>you can notice that you know,
it's not really always the case</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4842-3
00:38:31.159 --> 00:38:35.170
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>that elections can create a

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4842-4
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.835
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>sorry, accountable and

00:38:38.835 --> 00:38:43.054
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>the first thing. Another thing
is we actually don't have any</v>

00:39:03.408 --> 00:39:07.455
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>comes to empirical evidence or
when it comes to the mechanism,</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4928-3
00:39:07.455 --> 00:39:11.565
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>we don't know very much about.
So George Ofusso, he's a scholar</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4928-4
00:39:11.565 --> 00:39:15.676

00:39:15.676 --> 00:39:18.245
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>moment on his PhD thesis is
about this.</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4988-0
00:39:19.895 --> 00:39:24.038
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>He's trying to use some original
experimental experimental study,</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4988-1
00:39:24.038 --> 00:39:27.679
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>archival research, and the

00:39:27.679 --> 00:39:31.633
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>the mechanism for free and fair

00:39:31.633 --> 00:39:35.588

00:39:35.588 --> 00:39:39.480
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>out West and it's really great,
you know, first he shows that</v>

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/4988-5
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:43.309
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>free and fair elections don't

00:39:46.145 --> 00:39:50.113
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Good government, we will need
some additional condition for</v>

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:06.789

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.345

00:44:03.827 --> 00:44:07.963

<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>So that's one of the very

00:44:17.035 --> 00:44:20.981
<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>Which is how voters behave in

90e6a235-4232-4ebb-bf99-c9fe8d1f75c0/5640-1
00:44:20.981 --> 00:44:25.117

<v Chao-Yo Cheng (Staff)>published by annual reviews so
highly recommend. And I think</v>

00:44:32.054 --> 00:44:36.064
