Social research dissertation supervisor allocation

Dear all,

Thank you for submitting your dissertation plans.  The process of supervisor allocation was interrupted but is near completion.

You will receive an official confirmation email from the Department this week, but if you receive this message, it means we have worked out a supervisor for your dissertation.  Once you see the confirmation email, please reach out to your designated supervisor.

If you receive this message, it means we are still searching for a supervisor for you or have yet to hear from the choice you put in the dissertation.  I'd invite you to schedule a meeting with me this week, preferably using the link I sent before. 

We will have a dissertation workshop on Wednesday 23rd February, 6-7:30pm (see https://moodle.bbk.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=37230&section=3).  At the workshop, we will discuss several issues such as how to manage the dissertation process and how to build a fruitful working relationship with your supervisor, among other things.  Do feel free to come with questions.

Best,
Chao-yo
