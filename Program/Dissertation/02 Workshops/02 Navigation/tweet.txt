Was putting up readings for the next dissertation workshop for my MSc/MRes Social Research students at Birkbeck. One of the reasons that made my decide to join Birkbeck is I get to work with many first-gen PG students like me. It is truly a privilege to join an HEI that dedicates itself to promoting social mobility. 

Then I came across this podcast that I so want to share with them -- there are so many people I have to thank for getting where I am now, and I truly understood all the anxiety and struggle. Looking forward to the workshop in the coming term!

I am also thrilled to learn that I received this year's First Generation Scholar Travel and Accessibility Grant from APSA. The Montreal one was the first APSA I attended after I received my PhD, and I am truly grateful for all the support from APSA in the past decade.

can never thank APSA enough for their effort to help international minority first-generation scholar at different career stages succeed and offer them a place/voice in the discipline.
