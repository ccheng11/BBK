# Extra: Alternative Ways of Interpreting Results from Logit Regression

This section shows you additional options to interpret results from logit regression in addition to the options we discussed in Sections 3.3.

## Option 1: Interpret $\hat{\beta}$ Directly

From the output, we can see that $\hat{\beta}=1.17470$ is how the (expected) log-odds will change when we increase religion's degree of importance by 1. You can use the `confint()` function to extract the upper and lower bounds of the confidence intervals for $\hat{\beta}$.

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
coef(mod_religion) # extract coefficients
```  

## Option 2: The *Divide-by-4* Rule

Third, use the *divide-by-4* rule, we can derive the largest possible change in the probability of opposing abortion.

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
coef(mod_religion)[2]/4 # extract the "religion" coefficient 
```
