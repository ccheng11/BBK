Analyzing Survey Data

Hi -- I am Dr Chao-yo Cheng -- Welcome back to Intermediate Quantitative Social Research -- I hope everybody is doing well

- recap from week 4 -- survey is important -- use sample to study population -- very extrapolate some useful information -- weighting or survey weights are important to correct or adjust our statistical results -- careful and rigorous sampling procedures -- 

we introduce sample weight as the inverse proportional or reciprocal to the probability of a potential observation being included in the study

RCT (tradeoff between internal and external validity) -- weighting or not, that is the question -- recent students have become more careful

- last i have also demonstrated how we can use two survey and svyvr to implement descriptive statistical analysis or compute summary statistics of survey data, using the example from the 2011 Canadian National Election Study -- this week, we will cover the inferential statistical analysis of survey data (i.e., regression) and discuss some of the issues we have to address. 

- To put in a different way, we will be using logit to study the factors statistically associated with individuals' attitudes towards abortion.

As you remember from the previous term, logit is one of the most common generalized linear models (GLM).  In this video, I will provide a review so you will be prepared for Monday's tutorial session.  If you need to review some key mathematical concepts -- watch the videos.

Reorganize of some of the main points in the video you see in Term 1 -- outline is as follows:

from linear regression to logit

regression 

linear regression -- linear function to study the statistical relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables -- to simplify the following discussion -- we will just use one independent variable or predictor.

basic linear regression -- bivariate -- looks like this -- we have one predictor written in capital X and the dependent variable is written in capital Y -- if you remember from Term 1 -- we are trying to use regression analysis to find the line with the best fit of the data -- more specifically -- we are using regression analysis to find alpha and beta to complete the linear function presented here and this linear function (say the function) will produce the lowest sum of squared errors -- that is the basic idea of ordinary least squares (OLS).

linear regression is useful to tell us the nature of the statistical association between the dependent variable and the interdependent variables -- review week 1.5 -- or attend the review session.

while linear regression or OLS is useful, when it comes to binary dependent variables (define), it is problematic for many scholars due to several reasons.

- prediction

- ols assumptions

- outcome is not normally distributed (but not very important)

we need to twist the linear model to analyze binary DV

logit is one of them -- now, let's rewrite the dependent variable as p. again, if we use a linear function to study p, it is problematic

logit is model define  the dependent varfiable as the log of odds

p probv
odds -- intuition
log of odds -- marju's video to explain why log is useful, but we can talk about this in live session

before we continute, please watch this video to learn what is log and how it is related to exp

log of odds -- to be more careful is the log of odds with base e (a constant)


why glm? ols is a glm includes a linea function study non-linear

--

let's compare the interpretation of ols and logit model -- 

y = a + bx

x is the number of hours you spend on preparing the final exam of IQSR

y is your mark you get for the exam

say after you run the regression

0 1

log(p[/1-p]) = a + bx

three ways of interpretations

log

odds

divided by 4 b/4



prediction

logit(p) = log(p/1-9)

logit is a link function so we can model non-linear outcome with a linear function

caveat ucla thoughts annual review article

in live session do the logit model 

twist: including weights in our analysis
