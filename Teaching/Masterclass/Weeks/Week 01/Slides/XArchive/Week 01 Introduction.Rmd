# History and objectives

\begin{itemize}
\small
	\item The \textbf{Masterclass in Social Research} is the final 30-credit compulsory module for \textbf{MSc Social Research} students.
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Masterclass was created at the beginning of the Postgraduate Social Research Programmes to provide students at Birkbeck with a variety of methods training.
		\item While serving as a compulsory module for MSc students, the Masterclass is also open to research postgraduate students.
		\item The topics covered by the Masterclass may change from year to year based on staff availability and new developments in social research.
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item Following recent program restructuring, the Masterclass now serves two main objectives
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Produce a new group of competent social researchers with different career and academic interests
		\item Showcase cutting-edge social research methods while helping students reflect on some of the most common methods
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

# Module organization

\begin{itemize}
\small
	\item "Master" lecture series (6-7:30pm)
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each week will feature a speaker from an SSHP department who is an expert in the selected issue and method.
		\item The speakers will decide how they will deliver the lectures, with the use of different pre-sessional and/or in-class activities.
		\item \textbf{The lecture series is open to all taught and research postgraduate students and their participation will not be credited.}
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item "Pieces-of-the-craft" workshops (7:40-9pm)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each week will focus on a social research "skill" and the workshop activities will help students complete the required assessment.

# Exercise: Social research and social "sciences"

\begin{itemize}
  \item Share your subject area with each other.
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  \item Is your subject area a social "science?" 
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  \item Is your subject area "suffering" from any "bias" named by Grossmann?
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Individual diversity: Demographic, geographical, and political
    \item Scientific practice: Methodological, disciplinary, and institutional
    \item Innate difficulties: Temporal, cognitive, and application
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  \item If there is more than one subject area being named in your group, is any subject area "more scientific" than others? Why?
\end{itemize}

# Recap: Investigating the social world as a vocation

\begin{itemize}
  \item As a social researcher, we aim to produce "valid" knowledge about the social world.
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item The production of valid knowledge involves a series of careful thinking about ontology/epistemology, theory-building, and methodology (or the theory-empirics alignment).
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reveal nuances of the real world}: constructivism and interpretivism ; theory as approach; interpretation; qualitative; inductive/abductive
    \item \textbf{Search for the "ultimate" truth}: positivism; theory as paradigm; explanation; quantitative; deductive
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item A new definition of "better" social research is emerging as boundaries across subject areas and research methods are constantly being contested and redefined.
\end{itemize}
