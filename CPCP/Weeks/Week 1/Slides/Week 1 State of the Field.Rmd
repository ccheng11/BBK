# Three generations of China scholars during the Cold War (Harding 1984)

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1st generation (1960s)
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Focus on descriptive study and rely heavily on (limited) official data, such as Communist doctrine, policy, and organizational tables; many scholars completed their work in Taiwan 
    \item Research is mostly speculative and tentative (and yet suffering from over-generalization and under-conceptualization)
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \item 2nd generation (1970s)
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \item 3rd generation (1980s)
\end{itemize}

# Three generations of China scholars during the Cold War (Harding 1984)

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1st generation (1960s)
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \item 2nd generation (1970s)
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Aim to be conceptual and rely heavily on Red Guard materials to get behind-the-scene insights
    \item Start to disaggregate China by moving to subnational comparison
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \item 3rd generation (1980s)
\end{itemize}

# Three generations of China scholars during the Cold War (Harding 1984)

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1st generation (1960s)
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \item 2nd generation (1970s)
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \item 3rd generation (1980s)
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Engage more with comparative politics literature while utilizing the accumulation of empirical description of the Chinese regimes contributed by China scholars from previous generations
    \item China's Reform and Openness provides new materials and research opportunities
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

# New generations of China scholars after the Cold War (Shambaugh 2023)

\begin{itemize}
  \item The first three generations of China scholars more or less "completed" the field transition from area studies to political "science"
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \item China has also been used more generally to tackle broad theoretical puzzles in comparative politics and political economy
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The understanding of Chinese politics has in general moved from "totalitarianism" to "authoritarianism"
    \item Modern China studies have gradually moved away from the typical "cultural trap"
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \item Scholars have also been trained to use cutting-edge methods and rigorous research design
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \item However, two recent events have changed the research landscape: One is the abolition of the term limits for the Chinese president; one is the escalation of the geopolitical tension between the US and China; the consequences are profound
\end{itemize}

# "Bringing in China" (Tsai 2017)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Many political scientists have under-utilized or ignored the theoretical relevance of the study of Chinese politics
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item And yet China can contribute to the general political science research in many different ways
  \vspace{.01cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Using China to generate new research questions (by specifying the scope condition or conceptual equivalence)
    \item Using China to test the the scope of existing findings based on another country (e.g., the United States)
    \item Using China to demonstrate innovative methods of data collection combined with strong research design (e.g., King, Pan and Roberts 2013)
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item There exist many opportunities of theory building, in particular for the literatures on authoritarian governance, political development, and political economy of development
\end{itemize}

# "Bringing in China" (Tsai 2017)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Many political scientists have under-utilized or ignored the theoretical relevance of the study of Chinese politics
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item And yet China can contribute to the general political science research in many different ways
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item There exist many opportunities of theory building, in particular for the literatures on authoritarian governance, political development, and political economy of development
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Tsai seems to find China studies that can produce new research agenda more valuable, implicitly speaking. What do you think? 
    \item Which topic do you find most intruging? And are any of these questions relevant to the country you are most familiar with (e.g., United Kingdom)?
    \item Why does the question of "bringing in China into comparative politics" matter? What do you think? 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

# Discussion: "Why China's Reforms Have Delayed Democracy" (Gallagher 2002)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Which general theoretical puzzle did Gallagher attempt to speak to? (Hint: It is about Lipset)
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  \item Why is the case of "Reform and Openness" in China interesting or puzzling?
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  \item How did Gallagher dismiss conventional wisdom about the political implications of FDI liberalization and market reform? What is her alternative theory? How did her theory speak to the general theory of economic modernization and regime change?
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  \item Did Gallagher highlight the importance of culture in her argument? If not, why do you think that is the case? Do you agree with her?
\end{itemize}
