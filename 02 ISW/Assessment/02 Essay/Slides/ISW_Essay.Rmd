# Overview

\begin{itemize}
  \item You will write an essay of 2,500 words in length
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item The key idea is to choose \textbf{TWO} frameworks introduced after Reading Week to analyze an issue or problem of your choice
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item You are free to carry out any necessary outside/additional research; cite references properly (e.g., APA or MLA)
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item You can come to my office hours to discuss your preliminary responses with me; the goal is not to give you a mark before the deadline but to clear any confusion
\end{itemize}

# Questions

\begin{itemize}
\small
  \item \textbf{Choose two of the investigative frameworks introduced in the module and describe how they could be applied to an issue or problem of your choosing}
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Rational choice 
    \item Psychosocial framings
    \item Decolonizing social research
    \item Intersectional sensibilities
    \item Lived experience
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.4cm}
  \item \textbf{Discuss which of the two frameworks you choose is more compelling}
\end{itemize}

# Key tasks involved

\begin{itemize}
  \item Describe the frameworks and present the issue at stake
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \item Make a case for how each of these two frameworks could offer insight to the issue
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \item Explain which of the two frameworks is more compelling
\end{itemize}

# Step 1: Describe the frameworks

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use a reading or two to explain how you define/understand these frameworks, focusing on the aspects of it that are most relevant to you
  \vspace{0.4cm}
  \item Choose two frameworks only; in your dissertation, you might use more -- but here you do not have the space
\end{itemize}  

# Step 2: Present the issue

You do not need to be exhaustive in describing the issue but you should make reference to some kind of source materials -- such as academic or policy related research, a news article, and material from a grassroots organization or activist group.

# Step 3: Make your case and compare

\begin{itemize}
\small
  \item Make a case for how these frameworks could offer insight to the issue -- What questions would the framework allow you to ask and why might this be valuable?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item You could point to areas of potential investigation 
    \item You could point to existing research on your topic that doesn't give the kind of insight youâ€™re interested in
    \item You could point to research from that perspective on other issues that you find intriguing that might have relevance for your issue
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.3cm}
  \item Explain which of these two frameworks is more analytically compelling -- perhaps one framework can generate some more new insights than the other? Perhaps one framework can garner more empirical support than the other?
\end{itemize}

---

\begin{itemize}
  \item It is not a traditional essay -- no need to provide fully developed research questions here like you do for your dissertation; you are not making an argument or a full empirical analysis as such
  \vspace{0.6cm}
  \item A few sentences of overview at the start and some concluding reflections would be enough; what is your key takeaway from thinking this through?
\end{itemize}

# Reminders

\begin{itemize}
\small
  \item Before you start, \textbf{read the guidance and questions carefully}
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item When you submit your essay
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Attach the coversheet (available on Moodle)
    \item Enter your student ID in the field of \textbf{Submission Title} on Turnitin
    \item Submit your essay before \textbf{midday, 21 April 2025}
  \end{itemize}
