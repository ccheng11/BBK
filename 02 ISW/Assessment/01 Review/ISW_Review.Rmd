# Overview

\begin{itemize}
  \item You are going to examine a published peer-reviewed article (we have provided you with 9 articles to choose from)
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item You are going to answer \textbf{three} questions and write up to \textbf{500 words} for each question
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item No outside/additional research is needed; you will not need any citations; you should not need to quote anything in your response
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item \textbf{It is not a test} -- there is no rubric, and feel free to surprise us, but you will be evaluated based on the \textbf{quality} of your responses, using the concepts we have convered in class
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item You can come to my office hours to discuss your preliminary responses with me; the goal is not to give you a mark before the deadline but to clear any confusion
\end{itemize}

# Common issues to avoid

\begin{itemize}
\small
  \item \textbf{Writing Style and Clarity}: This theme received the most emphasis. Comments focused on the need for succinctness, clarity, and appropriate academic writing style, indicating that improving clarity and conciseness in writing was a frequent suggestion
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \item \textbf{Structure and Coherence}: Many submissions have issues with the overall structure and logical flow of the responses; the feedback suggests a need for better organization and coherence in presenting arguments and analysis
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \item \textbf{Analytical Depth and Application of Concepts}: This theme points to the need for deeper analytical engagement with the material and a better application of theoretical concepts in the analysis; many responses lacked depth or did not adequately apply class concepts to the articles being reviewed
\end{itemize}
