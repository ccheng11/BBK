# Critques: Rational choice as a case of "excessive" ambition (Green and Shapiro 1994; Elster 2000)

\begin{itemize}
	\item Too ambitous -- is rational choice theory a "universal" theory? Theory- or problem-driven?
	\vspace{0.3cm}
	\item The assumption for "rational" actors is too much, while rational choice is able to accommodate non-material or non-selfish interests
	\vspace{0.3cm}
	\item While the model is based on "individuals," aggregation of preferences may not be that straightforward (e.g., Arrow's impossibility theorem)
	\vspace{0.3cm}
	\item How about "beliefs" or "intentions?" And uncertainty, after all?
\end{itemize}
