# Questions to Think About

Geddes, Barbara. 2003. *Paradigms and Sandcastles*. Ann Arbor, MI: The University of Michigan Press. 

Consider the following questions:

 - Before you read Geddes' book, how will you define the “rational choice theory?”
 
 - After reading this chapter, how is Geddes' explanation of the rational choice theory different from yours? 

 - Can you guess why Geddes argues rational choice should be understood as an approach rather than a "theory?"

 - **[See extra lecture slides]** In Martin (2015), theory can be used as canonical and important propositions, as generalization, as vocabulary and as critique.  How will you categorize rational choice theory based on Geddes' explanations for this theory?
