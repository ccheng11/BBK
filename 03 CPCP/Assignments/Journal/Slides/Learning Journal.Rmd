  \item \textbf{Utilize Google Scholar to explore how other scholars have cited the article you select}. What are some common themes among these articles? Is the article you choose predominantly cited by scholars who specialize in China, or has it also garnered attention from scholars who do not focus on China? {Do you believe that the article, while centered on China, holds broader implications for scholars who study countries other than China?} Discuss.
