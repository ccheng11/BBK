## Motivation

\vspace{0.1cm}
\begincols
\begincol{.5\textwidth}
  Racial and ethnic diversity is often associated with a variety of economic and political predicaments.
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{small}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Corruption and political rent-seeking
  \item Income inequality and discrimination
  \item Lack of local public goods provision and government services
  \item Conflicts within and across different states
  \end{itemize}
  \end{small}

## Motivation

\vspace{0.1cm}
\begincols
\begincol{.5\textwidth}
  How do autocratic leaders overcome these potential predicaments brought by racial and ethnic diversity?
  \vspace{0.25cm}
  \begin{small}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Conventional wisdom asserts that autocrats usually dismiss and oppress ethnic cleavages.
    \vspace{0.15cm}
    \item History has seen dictators accommodating the needs of ethnic minority or non-core groups.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{small}

## Questions

\begin{itemize}
  \item Why do autocrats grant \textbf{ethnic local autonomy}?
  \vspace{0.15cm}
  \item When and where will autocrats designate \textbf{ethnic autonomous territories} (EATs)?
  \vspace{0.15cm}
  \item How can local (policy/administrative) decentralization contribute to political centralization?
\end{itemize}

\begincol{.5\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 5 \textbf{Ethnic autonomous regions}: Inner Mongolia (1947), Xinjiang (1955), Guangxi (1958), Ningxia (1958), and Tibet (1965).
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    \item 30 \textbf{Ethnic autonomous prefectures}.
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    \item 120 \textbf{Ethnic autonomous counties}.
  \end{itemize}
\endcol
\endcols

## Ethnic local autonomy in post-1949 China

\vspace{0.4cm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item About 14\% of the total population live in EATs.
  \item EATs account are present in more than $2/3$ of provinces.
\end{itemize}

## Ethnic local autonomy in post-1949 China

\vspace{0.4cm}
The designation of EATs has exhibited significant changes both over time and across different jurisdictional levels in the country since 1949.
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{figure}
  \centering

\end{figure}

## Ethnic local autonomy in post-1949 China

\vspace{0.4cm}
Compared with provincial EATs (e.g., Tibet and Xinjiang), subprovincial EATs are more active in exercising their granted local autonomy.

## Common views (and why they are problematic)

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figs/common}
\end{figure}

## Main argument

Ethnic local autonomy helps the Chinese central leader address \textbf{the dilemma of delegation} and minimize \textbf{agency loss}.
  \begin{small}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The central leader designates EATs to constrain the power of provincial elites who are likely to resist his command.
    \item The central leader is more likely to create EATs when he faces strong rivals within the central leadership.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{small}
Ethnic local autonomy empowers \textbf{local non-Han cadres} in selected jurisdictions where \textbf{Han provincial elites} only have limited control.
\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figs/chain}
  \caption{Delegation dynamics between the central leader, provincial elites, and sub-provincial jurisdictions.}
\end{figure}

## Hypotheses

\begin{itemize}
  \item EAT designations tend to take place when the central leader faces agent problems within and outside the central leadership.
  \begin{itemize}
	  \item The central leader is \textbf{more} likely to create EATs when the central leadership is fragmented.
	  \item The central leader is \textbf{more} likely to create EATs in provinces where the provincial leader has an independent, embedded local power base outside his reach.
	  \item The central leader is \textbf{less} likely to create EATs in provinces where the provincial leader has a connection with the center.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Empirical strategy: Qualitative

\begincols
\begincol{.43\textwidth}
  \begin{small}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Archival research} in the US, Hong Kong, and Mainland China.
  \item \textbf{Expert interviews}: Conversations with Han and non-Han cadres at the central and local levels across different provinces.
  \item \textbf{Comparative case studies}: Process tracing the designation of ethnic autonomous prefectures in post-1949 China.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{small}
\endcol

  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[scale=0.43]{Figs/sites_6}
\end{figure}
\endcol
\endcols

## Empirical strategy: Quantitative

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Supervised machine learning} and \textbf{social network analysis}: Capturing the \textit{connectedness} and \textit{network structure} among/between central and local cadres based on an original biographical dataset of Chinese political elites (1949-2003).
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Between the pair of cadres, I create the indices of \textbf{connectedness} based on their \textbf{biographical simularity}.
	  \begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.52]{Figs/cpen}
\end{figure}
	  \item The same connectedness measure can be used to construct the information network of Politburo members and measure the degree of \textbf{central leadership fragmentation} by \textbf{community detection}.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Multivariate regression}: Modeling the number of active EATs as a function of different explanatory and control variables.
\end{itemize}

## Findings

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Ethnic local autonomy acts as an institution of agent control}.
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.51]{Figs/findings}
  \end{figure}
  \item \textit{EATs can act as enclaves that constrain provincial elites' power}.
  \begin{itemize}
    \begin{small}
    \item Sub-provincial EATs are \textbf{more} likely to pass and revise autonomous regulations when the provincial elites are potentially defiant.
    \item Ruling non-Han cadres in sub-provincial EATs are \textbf{less} likely to have worked at the provincial level prior to their appointments.
    \end{small}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Extension: Beyond ethnic local autonomy in post-1949 China

\begin{itemize}
	\item Going \textbf{cross-national}: Post-WWII authoritarian regimes are more likely to introduce regional autonomy to ethnic minorities when their ruling power is contested within the inner circle.
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item Going back to \textbf{history}: Post-civil war \textit{decentralization} and \textit{state power consolidation} in imperial and Republican China:
	\begin{small}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Western Han dynasty (202 BCâ€“220 AD): Kingdoms and marquis states.
	  \item The Kuomintang (KMT) regime (1928-1949 AD): Countering recalcitrant provincial warlords through the county-level self-government movement. 
	\end{itemize}
	\end{small}
\end{itemize}

## Appendix: Ethnic local autonomy in post-1949 China

\begin{itemize}
	\item 1949-1958: Accommodation/toleration via the official recognition of non-Han ethnic categories and EAT designations.
	\item 1958-1978: Repressive assimilation during the Great Leap Forward and the suspension of ethnic local autonomy during the Cultural Revolution.
	\item 1978-1992: Restoration and expansion (the Law on Ethnic Local Autonomy was passed in 1984).
	\item 1992-current: EATs as the destination of patronage and subsidies. 
\end{itemize}

## Appendix: Regression analysis	

\begin{itemize}
	\item Dependent variable: Number of active EAT designations -- the creation, suspension, and restoration.
	\item Explanatory variables:	
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Central fragmentation: The modularity of the Politburo network.
	  \item Local embeddedness: The connectedness between the provincial Party secretary and governor.
	  \item Central-local connectedness: The (relative) connectedness between the provincial Party secretary and the formal Party head.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Controls: Ethnic demography, economic productivity, provincial leadership turnover, provincial fixed effects, latent time trend, etc.
\end{itemize}
