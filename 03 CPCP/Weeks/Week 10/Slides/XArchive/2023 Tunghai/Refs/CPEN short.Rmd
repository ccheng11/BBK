## The black box of Chinese elite politics

\begin{itemize}
	\item The focus on ``high-politics:'' The absence of independent, strong formal institutions has pushed researchers have to focus on prominent political elites in authoritarian regimes.
	\item \textbf{Factionalism} is one of the most researched topics in the Chinese politics literature (e.g., Nathan 1973; Tsou 1976; Pye 1981; Dittmer 2002; Huang 2006; Bo 2007; Shih et al 2012).
	\item The power struggles and cooperation between different factions or ``informal'' groups have been considered as the main driving forces for policy and political changes in China.
\end{itemize}

## The task: Unpack Chinese elite politics

\begin{itemize}
  \item Qualitative analysis: Studies in the early decades rely on information provided by the regime's ``insiders.''
  \item Quantitative measures: Studies in the past two decades have started to use publicly available information to elite ties and interactions.
  \begin{itemize}
	  \item Party newspapers (e.g., Yang 1987; Kou and Cheng 2006; Kou et al 2010).
	  \item Biographical information; \textit{Nomenklatura} (e.g., Bo 2003; Shih, Shan, and Wei 2010).
	  \item Elite actitivites.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## (Re)conceptualizing elite connectedness

\begin{itemize}
	\item Personal ties provide individuals with protection in a highly uncertain and opaque political environment (Pye 1981; Dittmer 2002).
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item The literature has provided many different sources of interpersonal ties (e.g., common provincial origin, common schools, and common workplace).
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item Existing measures largely focus on one of the possible sources and treat elite ties as a binary, static variable.
\end{itemize}

## (Re)conceptualizing elite connectedness

\begin{itemize}
	\item We can define \textit{connectedness} as a \textbf{\textit{continuous}} variable that indicates the degree to which two individuals.
	\item We can use the degree of \textit{biographical similarity} to measure their connectedness.
\end{itemize}

## Measuring elite connectedness

\begin{itemize}
	\item Create the timeline of key life events of each cadre.
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Demographic characteristics (e.g., birth year and provincial origin)
	  \item Educational background (e.g., colleges and universities)
	  \item Political career (e.g., involvement in key events between 1921 and 1949; Party and government posts after 1949)
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item Create the \textbf{\textit{attribute vector}} of a cadre based on her/her timeline.
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item Measure the distance between a pair of attribute vectors in the multidimensional space.
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Time: Are the cadres of interest both alive in a given year?
	  \item Location: Are they both at the same location in a given year?
	  \item Activity: Are they working in the same department/unit in a given year?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Measuring elite connectedness

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Gaussian kernel generalizes the dot-product of two vectors into an infinite dimensional feature space.
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item The resulting value is a time-varying measure of elite connectedness.
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item Formally, a kernel is a function of $R^P \times R^P \rightarrow R$ such that $k(x_i, x_j) \rightarrow R$ for two vectors $x_i$ and $x_j$.
	\begin{equation}
	k(X_i, X_j)=k(\phi(X_i),\phi(X_j))=e^{-\frac{||X_i-X_j||^2}{\sigma^2}}
	\end{equation}
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\phi(X_i)$ is the ``feature map'' of the vector $X_i$.
	\item $||X_i-X_j||$ is the Euclidean distance between vectors $X_i$ and $X_j$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Mapping elite networks

We can construct the adjacency matrix, an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix to represent a network of $n$ cadres, as follows.
\begin{equation}
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0 & k(X_1, X_2) & k(X_1, X_3) & \dots & k(X_1, X_n) \\
    k(X_2, X_1) & 0 & k(X_2, X_3) & \dots & k(X_2, X_n) \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    k(X_n, X_1) & k(X_n, X_n) & k(X_n, X_3) & \dots & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $k(X_i, X_j)$ refers to the connectedness between a pair of cadres $i$ and $j$.

## Data sources

\begin{itemize}
  \item Central Committee Members, 1921-2017 (about 2,000).
  \item Provincial Party secretaries and governors, 1947-2017 (about 500).
  \item District Party secretaries and government heads, 1949-2017 (about 4,000).
  \item County Party secretaries and government heads, 2000-2017 (about 12,000).
\end{itemize}

## Central leadership fragmentation

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use \textbf{variable selection} (elastic net regularization and other methods) to identify the key biographical variables in CC of each year when measuring biographical similarity.
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\item Use \textbf{community detection} to assess the degree to which a Politburo network can be divided.
\end{itemize}

The fragmentation measure is largely consistent with the personalism measure constructed by Frantz et al 2018.

## Concluding remarks

\begin{itemize}
	\item Decompose and redefine elite connection to elite \textbf{\textit{connectedness}}.
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item Build a general framework for different measures of elite connectedness.
	\vspace{0.2cm}
\pause
	\item What does a tie entail for Chinese political elites?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Patron-client relationship (e.g., Keller 2016, Jiang 2018).
	\item Social capital and inter-personal trust (e.g., Stockmann et al 2020).
	\item Principal-agent relationship: Transaction cost and the degree of observability (e.g., Holmstrom 1979) or information symmetry.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Concluding remarks

\begin{itemize}
	\item Apply the new measures of elite connectedness to replicate existing studies of the Chinese political economy.
	\item Explore interactive dynamics of local (provincial, municipal, and county) officials.
  \item Different dimensions of connectedness: Organization-based or location-based.
  \item Employ alternative computational approaches (e.g., the distance metric between vectors; feature selection).
	\item \textbf{In progress}: An open-source \texttt{R} package \textit{Chinese Political Elite Networks} (C-PEN).
\end{itemize}

## Debates in Chinese elite politics

\begin{itemize}
	\item Nature of elite politics: ``Factions'' vs. ``informal groups.''
	\item Structure of factional politics: Vertical patron-client relationship?
	\item Dynamics of factional politics: Code of civility? Bandwagoning? Self-enforcing?
\end{itemize}

## Quality function for community detection

\begin{equation}
Q = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{ij}(A_{ij}-P_{ij})\delta(c_i,c_j).
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
	\small
	\item $m$ is the number of ties or edges of the network (or the sum over all pairs of nodes $i$ and $j$).
	\item $A_{ij}$ refers to the tie between $i$ and $j$ in $A$ (the adjacency matrix of a network). For a weighted network, $A_{ij}\in R^{+}$; for an unweighted network, $A_{ij}\in\{0,1\}$.
	\item $\delta(c_i,c_j)=1$ (also known as the Kronecker delta) if $i$ and $j$ are in the same community (0 otherwise).
	\item $P_{ij}$ is the expected weight of the edge (for a weighted network) between $i$ and $j$ under a specified null model. For unweighted networks, in which each non-diagonal element in the adjacency matrix only takes the value of 0 or 1, $P_{ij}$ is the expected number of ties between $i$ and $j$ of an ensemble of networks based on the randomization of the original network.
\end{itemize}

## Attribute vectors

Suppose both cadres work in different departments in Year 1 and become colleagues in Year 2. Each column is named by
\begin{itemize}
  \item Y: Year (time)
  \item P: Province (location)
  \item D: Department/unit (activity)
