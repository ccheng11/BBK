## Research proposal: Looking ahead

\begin{itemize}
	\item Attend the Q\&A session with Dr Power on \textbf{Wednesday, 2 February 2022 at 2pm}
	\item Submit on on \textbf{Thursday, 3 March 2022 at 4pm}
	\item Receive feedback by \textbf{Thursday, 31 March 2022} in time for you to prepare for the Summer Term Dissertation Workshops
\end{itemize}

## Research proposal: Looking ahead

\begin{itemize}
  \item State the \textbf{research question(s)} that you could answer within the constraints of a dissertation.
  \item Provide the \textbf{background literature} -- what is the body of literature that your RQs emerges from and that you plan to speak to? 
  \item Present a \textbf{research design} to explain data collection and analysis.
  \item Discuss the \textbf{limitations and critical considerations} specific to your research design.
  \item Bibliography.
\end{itemize}

## Research proposal: Looking ahead

\begin{itemize}
	\item Research question(s) that are sufficiently focused and tractable.
	\item Literature review that sets the relevant context and motivates the research question -- what is the gap?
	\item A research design that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item describes the type(s) of evidence which will be collected and analyzed to address the research question;
		\item shows that the proposed evidence can feasibly be collected in the timeframe available;
		\item outlines feasible method(s) that will be used to analyze the evidence.
	\end{itemize}
	\item A thoughtful discussion on the expected relative strengths and limitations of the combination of evidence and analytical method.
\end{itemize}

## Explaining/discussing research design: Process tracing and case studies

\begin{itemize}
	\item Literature review: How do you use the literature to motivate the study? What is the puzzle? Why is this study interesting, in relation to what we already know or assume?
	\item How do you justify the selection of cases for comparison? What is the evidence that these cases are different on the independent and dependent variables while being mostly similar in other aspects?
	\item What is your proposed explanation? Where does the evidence come from? What is the most convincing piece of evidence?
	\item Are there any alternative explanations in addition to the central argument?
	\item Which part of your argument could be generalized to other contexts? What is the scope condition?
\end{itemize}

## Explaining/discussing research design: Quantitative research design

\begin{itemize}
  \item Basic components
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The key empirical \textbf{question(s)}?
	  \item The key \textbf{hypotheses} (empirical or testable implications) based on the theoretical literature?
	  \item The key \textbf{independent} (explanatory) and \textbf{dependent} (outcome) variables?
	  \item The key \textbf{statistical result(s)} we expect to observe in the regression table(s)?
  \end{itemize} 
  \item Advanced components
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Are all necessary \textbf{control} variables (covariates) included in the model?
	  \item Are there any additional tests to assess the \textbf{robustness} of the main results? Are there any tests to study the \textbf{heterogeneous} effect (i.e., do the main findings change if we divide up the observations)?
	  \item What else can be or should have been tested?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Explaining/discussing research design: Qualitative research design

\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the key concept from the literature that you seek to engage with? How do you motivate your study with reference to the literature?
  \item How do you justify the case selection? Is it a typical case? An exceptional case? What puzzle can it contribute to solving?  
  \item How will the qualitative methods used allow you to answer the research questions? Is there anything that might be missed out, with your design?  
  \item Is anything in your research paper generalizable to other settings? 
  \item How does your research provide a sense of ``being there?'' 
\end{itemize}

## Research proposal exercise

\begin{itemize}
	\item Women empowerment
	\item Disaster and resilience
	\item Decentralization and political favoritism
	\item Micro-finance and cash transfers
	\item Post-colonial experience
\end{itemize}

## Research proposal exercise (using examples on Moodle)

\begin{itemize}
  \item what the research question is
  \item what the research design is and why the proposed design could produce useful findings to answer the research question
  \item what limitations are acknowledged and whether there are any that aren't
  \item how feasible do you think the project is
  \item how is the bibliography structured (as opposed to just its content)
  \item what lessons you've learned for your own RP
\end{itemize}
