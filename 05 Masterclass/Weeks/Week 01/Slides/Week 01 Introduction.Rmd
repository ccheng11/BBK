# Plan for today

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{About Masterclass}
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item History and learning objectives
		\item Weekly syllabus
		\item Assessment and requirements
		\item Module contact
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{0.3cm}
	\item \textbf{Introduction}: Tell us about yourself
	\vspace{0.3cm}
	\item \textbf{Exercise}: The mysterious case of "AI for Social Research"
\end{itemize}

# History and objectives

\begin{itemize}
\small
	\item The \textbf{Masterclass in Social Research} is the final compulsory module for \textbf{MSc Social Research} students
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Masterclass was created at the beginning to provide SR students with a variety of methods training
		\item While serving as a compulsory module for MSc SR students, Masterclass is also open to PGR students
		\item The topics covered may change from year to year based on staff availability and new developments in social research
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item Following recent program restructuring, Masterclass now serves two main objectives
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Produce a new group of competent social researchers with different career and academic objectives
		\item Showcase cutting-edge social research methods while helping students reflect on some of the most common ones
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

# Module organization

\begin{itemize}
\small
	\item "Master" lecture series (6-7:30pm)
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each week will feature a speaker who is an expert in the selected issue and method
		\item The speakers will decide how they will deliver the lectures, with the use of different pre-sessional and/or in-class activities
		\item \textbf{The lecture series is open to all taught and research postgraduate students and their participation will not be credited}
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item "Pieces-of-the-craft" workshops (7:40-9pm)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each week will focus on a social research "skill" and the workshop activities will help students complete the required assessment
		\item Between Weeks 8-11, students will participate in the "dissertation fairs" where they share their research ideas and receive feedback
		\item \textbf{The workshops are only open to students who are taking Masterclass for credits}
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{0.1cm}
\end{itemize}

# Assessment (if you are taking Masterclass for credits)

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Two blog posts} (40\%): Write a blog post to summarize and reflect on \textbf{two of the lectures}; one lecture from Weeks 2-5 with the other one from Weeks 7-11
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	\item \textbf{A critical reflection paper} (60\%)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Write a critical reflection paper (4,000 words max) to discuss how Masterclass helps with you research
		\item Provide (1) a summary of your research project, (2) a discussion on how AI can help with your project and (3) a response to the questions/comments/critiques you receive during the presentation
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

# Role of the moderator (i.e., Chao-yo)

\begin{itemize}
	\item The moderator will join the lecture series to
	\vspace{0.1cm}

	  \item Introduce the speaker
	  \item Moderate the Q\&A or discussion, if necessary
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{0.3cm}
	\item The moderator will lead the workshops and provide feedback on your assignments 
	\vspace{0.3cm}
	\item The moderator is available to answer your questions
	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Students are encouraged to schedule 1:1 meetings during my office hours (Friday 3-5pm) or by appointment
	  \item All meetings take place via Teams by default -- email if you'd like to meet in person
	  \item Read the module handbook for details contact policy
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

# Knowing each other

\begin{itemize}
	\item Please share your name, course, and subject area (e.g., political science) with us
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\item What are the methods you have learned or used previously?
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\item What project are you working on at this moment?
\end{itemize}

# Recap: Investigating the social world as a vocation

\begin{itemize}
  \item As a social researcher, we aim to produce "valid" knowledge about the social world
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item The production of valid knowledge involves a series of careful thinking about ontology/epistemology, theory-building, and methodology (or the theory-empirics alignment)
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reveal nuances of the real world}: constructivism and interpretivism ; theory as approach; interpretation; qualitative; inductive/abductive
    \item \textbf{Search for the "ultimate" truth}: positivism; theory as paradigm; explanation; quantitative; deductive
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item A new definition of "better" social research is emerging as boundaries across subject areas and research methods are constantly being contested and redefined
\end{itemize}
