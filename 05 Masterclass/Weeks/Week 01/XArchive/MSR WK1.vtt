a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/54-0
00:00:06.446 --> 00:00:10.204
Right. So I'm going to record
from the first to part of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/54-1
00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:14.566
lecture until I need you guys to
introduce yourself and we start

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/54-2
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:18.929
a discussion session for today.
So which I think will take about

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/54-3
00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.754
maybe one hour each. We
definitely don't have to use the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/54-4
00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:27.116
entire 3 hours because our main
objective today is just, well, a

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/54-5
00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:28.056
couple things.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/81-0
00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:32.341
Birth to two let you understand.
You know why Masterclass is a

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/81-1
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:35.485
really special and unique
module. Perfect. And the second

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/81-2
00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:38.845
you know what I really want you
guys to do in this module and

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/81-3
00:00:38.845 --> 00:00:39.496
the finally.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/153-0
00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:45.137
To know more about, you know who
you are. But I I I know you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/153-1
00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:48.260
already, but I think I need to
know more about you as a

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/153-2
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.717
researcher. Like what kind of
research are you doing? Because

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/153-3
00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:55.119
master class, as some sense.
It's really not a typical model

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/153-4
00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:58.297
in the sense that we're not
really possible for this. We

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/153-5
00:00:58.297 --> 00:01:01.643
have tipped trying to teach you
guys something, but a large

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/153-6
00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:05.267
portion of Masterclass actually
requires you. You, you know, you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/153-7
00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:08.446
contribute, you know, because we
want to make sure that.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/231-0
00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:15.293
You will be useful for your
research, which can be your

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/231-1
00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:19.464
dissertation and the if you are
not doing dissertation at this

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/231-2
00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:23.634
moment, at least you know well.
Hopefully some things we do in

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/231-3
00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:27.672
class will help you to think
about your dissertation for the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/231-4
00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:31.909
next year, and we also have some
research postgraduate students

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/231-5
00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.749
here and I think the reason why
we inspired post graduate

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/231-6
00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:39.986
students working with suspicion
publics because we want to give

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/231-7
00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:41.376
them the opportunity.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/233-0
00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:42.426
To.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/249-0
00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:49.375
To get exposure about some of
the new recent developments in

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/249-1
00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.526
Social Research because on.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/339-0
00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:56.251
Social Research is a really
weird fear because on the one

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/339-1
00:01:56.251 --> 00:02:00.147
hand it's poorly defined. I
don't really know what it's sort

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/339-2
00:02:00.147 --> 00:02:03.980
of research that does, even
though Burbank had me to be the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/339-3
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.557
the director of the Social
Research program. But at the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/339-4
00:02:07.557 --> 00:02:11.646
same time, the Social Research
is also subject to a lot of ways

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/339-5
00:02:11.646 --> 00:02:15.478
conversations and the things
change a lot. So that's one of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/339-6
00:02:15.478 --> 00:02:19.247
the reasons why Masterclass was
created about 10 years ago

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/339-7
00:02:19.247 --> 00:02:23.016
because we wanted created a
space where students and also.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/345-0
00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.566
Things that we have the
opportunity.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/349-0
00:02:27.296 --> 00:02:29.376
You know, cutting edge.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/380-0
00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:33.658
Recent discussions, debates
about, you know, what is good

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/380-1
00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:37.677
Social Research. Either it can
be about, you know, new methods,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/380-2
00:02:37.677 --> 00:02:41.571
right. So we have only spent
three weeks on computational, so

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/380-3
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:42.576
it does not end.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/393-0
00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:46.682
None of this, you know, I say
push that none of these new

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/393-1
00:02:46.682 --> 00:02:47.746
methods has say.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/461-0
00:02:48.926 --> 00:02:52.324
Clear role like or or like,
people don't really have a

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/461-1
00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:56.154
consensus about. You know why we
should use this method or if

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/461-2
00:02:56.154 --> 00:02:59.984
when we are using this method
you know what, I'll hang up the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/461-3
00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:03.876
good practice or you know, just
even why we need this message,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/461-4
00:03:03.876 --> 00:03:07.768
right? So we're also going to
spend some weeks going over, you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/461-5
00:03:07.768 --> 00:03:11.351
know, some of the very popular
methods, you know, and you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/461-6
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.625
probably have learned this
methods in other modules,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/461-7
00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:18.517
especially N modules, right. And
if you are not on the student

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/461-8
00:03:18.517 --> 00:03:18.826
with.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/521-0
00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:22.851
Plus, you're if you're not a
student of M SC Social Research,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/521-1
00:03:22.851 --> 00:03:26.299
you probably have learned how to
for the methods in other

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/521-2
00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.628
modules. If you say come from
several social studies on

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/521-3
00:03:29.628 --> 00:03:33.254
independent research module
should have already provided you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/521-4
00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:36.820
with the opportunity to have
some discussion about research

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/521-5
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.090
methods and research design. So
the second part of the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/521-6
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.646
Masterclass webtoons and use
that you can.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/523-0
00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:44.036
Open.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/550-0
00:03:45.596 --> 00:03:50.533
Really interesting discussion is
because you hear something. If

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/550-1
00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:55.162
you are M SC Social Research
students, you have been seeing

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/550-2
00:03:55.162 --> 00:03:56.396
me laslow Barry.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/617-0
00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:02.249
Yes, we teach you guys methods,
but eventually you know you need

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/617-1
00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:06.101
to listen to other scholars,
especially scholars from other

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/617-2
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:09.632
subject areas to talk about
methods, right? So we have

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/617-3
00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:13.099
colleagues from and so when
colleagues Dr. joined our

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/617-4
00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.144
Barros, she's going to introduce
her best to geographical data

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/617-5
00:04:17.144 --> 00:04:21.124
science. That's one of the more
I think error at this moment.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/617-6
00:04:21.124 --> 00:04:25.169
And I actually don't know what's
going on there. But I told me

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/617-7
00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.646
he's a really powerful.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/627-0
00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.606
And in two of us to understand
things.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/678-0
00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:33.514
Urban Development over
urbanization, either in the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/678-1
00:04:33.514 --> 00:04:36.969
global north and global apps,
and you also don't have the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/678-2
00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.424
another colleague from geography
to talk about making the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/678-3
00:04:40.424 --> 00:04:43.938
research and the difference
between the way Lori and Paige

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/678-4
00:04:43.938 --> 00:04:47.751
talk about mixed method research
and her way to talk about this

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/678-5
00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:51.206
is because Laura and I, we are
postponing the scientists.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/705-0
00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:56.286
So we probably, you know,
sometimes we'll talk about mixed

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/705-1
00:04:56.286 --> 00:05:00.485
method overlaps good way because
we read a textbook on mixed

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/705-2
00:05:00.485 --> 00:05:01.586
method and blog.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/715-0
00:05:01.726 --> 00:05:05.786
There's no this is mixed method,
but the calling function.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/728-0
00:05:06.296 --> 00:05:10.192
She's going to talk to you guys
about mixed method from Earth.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/728-1
00:05:10.192 --> 00:05:11.676
There is they said it's.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/741-0
00:05:13.216 --> 00:05:16.208
I don't know you, but I think
because she would not help

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/741-1
00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:16.576
myself.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/776-0
00:05:17.186 --> 00:05:20.618
But she told me there will be
abilities I don't really know

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/776-1
00:05:20.618 --> 00:05:24.107
what she's gonna do. She also
told me there's not. She's not

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/776-2
00:05:24.107 --> 00:05:27.710
gonna use any required meetings
for that module. I'm sorry for

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/776-3
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.026
that, but they will be.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/791-0
00:05:29.106 --> 00:05:33.497
Umm ohhh, there will be some
activities and I will. I will

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/791-1
00:05:33.497 --> 00:05:36.176
make sure to double check with
her.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/799-0
00:05:37.056 --> 00:05:39.846
Because I I don't think I should
know. What if?

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/808-0
00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:44.346
Or you guys come to the class
and the final we have?

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/842-0
00:05:44.706 --> 00:05:49.618
You know what? I got to this
study. When is well, where some

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/842-1
00:05:49.618 --> 00:05:54.611
of them. And then we also have
some guidelines to talk about.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/842-2
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:59.604
It's not worth me. And the last
two weeks are computed by two

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/842-3
00:05:59.604 --> 00:06:01.376
scholars from history.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/854-0
00:06:02.516 --> 00:06:05.472
Classics and archaeology
department. And in case you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/854-1
00:06:05.472 --> 00:06:06.086
don't know.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/859-0
00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:08.496
I'm thinking about bank.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/873-0
00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:12.906
Has a long tradition that such
that you know it's not.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/927-0
00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:17.192
Only one of the biggest history
departments in the country, it

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/927-1
00:06:17.192 --> 00:06:20.902
is also one of the best and the
one of the most difficult things

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/927-2
00:06:20.902 --> 00:06:24.098
about history as the subject
area. But that is they are

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/927-3
00:06:24.098 --> 00:06:27.694
really close to customers that
they're not like, you know, the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/927-4
00:06:27.694 --> 00:06:30.947
traditional or conventional
historians who mostly do you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/927-5
00:06:30.947 --> 00:06:34.201
humanities. They are acting
really close to you. So just

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/927-6
00:06:34.201 --> 00:06:34.486
fine.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/942-0
00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:39.163
So for instance, we are gonna
have a scholar. He's. I think

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/942-1
00:06:39.163 --> 00:06:41.736
it's expertise. It's economic
history.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/953-0
00:06:42.726 --> 00:06:45.416
I promise history you can
understand the economic history.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/968-0
00:06:46.326 --> 00:06:51.061
These are basically a group of
people who are historians but

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/968-1
00:06:51.061 --> 00:06:52.536
also do regression.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/981-0
00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:57.617
Go to use data to you know
understand you something really

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/981-1
00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:58.256
important.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/997-0
00:06:58.916 --> 00:07:03.905
Umm, questions in economic
history and in recent years on

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/997-1
00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:05.626
also have a similar.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/999-0
00:07:06.456 --> 00:07:06.846
20.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1040-0
00:07:08.556 --> 00:07:12.006
You're completely conomy.
Basically, we have control

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1040-1
00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:16.173
political economist that we try
and use existing answer some of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1040-2
00:07:16.173 --> 00:07:19.818
the most important theoretical
or empirical properties,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1040-3
00:07:19.818 --> 00:07:23.724
including conomy such as you
know, we just said building or

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1040-4
00:07:23.724 --> 00:07:27.240
technician or long term
development or even political

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1040-5
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.956
corruption.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1106-0
00:07:28.616 --> 00:07:32.476
Or democratization. These kind
of things. So yeah. So I mean,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1106-1
00:07:32.476 --> 00:07:36.336
I'm very glad, you know, like
just this is a strange magic in

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1106-2
00:07:36.336 --> 00:07:40.382
the sense that even though, you
know, they put my name as malgir

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1106-3
00:07:40.382 --> 00:07:44.304
combiner. But really my role for
this module is the moderator.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1106-4
00:07:44.304 --> 00:07:48.289
I'm a moderator for this module.
So my main job is just to make

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1106-5
00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:52.086
sure everybody including the
speaker and including you guys,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1106-6
00:07:52.086 --> 00:07:55.386
show up at the same time, right,
place I have to do.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1151-0
00:08:03.886 --> 00:08:07.500
Hey So what I'm thinking to do
today is to talk about history

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1151-1
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.114
objective and also I'm going to
introduce our weekly syllabus

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1151-2
00:08:11.114 --> 00:08:14.845
because I'll be organization of
arrangement for the Masterclass

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1151-3
00:08:14.845 --> 00:08:15.486
is special.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1206-0
00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:20.252
And I moved a bunch of profile
time actually, but I think it's

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1206-1
00:08:20.252 --> 00:08:23.431
especially if you're going to
take the matter class for

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1206-2
00:08:23.431 --> 00:08:27.121
credit, I'm going to explain the
assessment and the requirements

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1206-3
00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:30.527
because assessment for the
masterclass and both of you need

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1206-4
00:08:30.527 --> 00:08:33.990
compared with other modules. And
finally, I was going to say

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1206-5
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.636
something about it, you know.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1244-0
00:08:36.146 --> 00:08:39.786
Uh, when I'm really doing for
this module and how you can

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1244-1
00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:43.238
utilize me as the module
moderator for the masterclass

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1244-2
00:08:43.238 --> 00:08:47.192
and the finally we're going to
spend some time to give you the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1244-3
00:08:47.192 --> 00:08:48.636
opportunity to do this.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1316-0
00:08:49.126 --> 00:08:53.204
Ohh yourself, because OK, I do.
I do want to know more about

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1316-1
00:08:53.204 --> 00:08:57.417
you. Especially I want to know
more about you as a researcher.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1316-2
00:08:57.417 --> 00:09:01.562
No longer as a student. Right.
And we I hope you look at some

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1316-3
00:09:01.562 --> 00:09:05.774
of the reason specially the book
written by Matt firstly how's

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1316-4
00:09:05.774 --> 00:09:09.786
the science staff? Better.
That's actually a excellent book

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1316-5
00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:14.065
because the reason why I chose
the book I was going to sign the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1316-6
00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:18.277
book and eventually I realized
this is probably too much but I

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1316-7
00:09:18.277 --> 00:09:20.016
highly recommend the book.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1343-0
00:09:20.096 --> 00:09:24.035
Because the book is very good in
terms of, you know, summarizing

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1343-1
00:09:24.035 --> 00:09:27.792
some of the most important and
challenging discussions about,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1343-2
00:09:27.792 --> 00:09:30.156
you know, what is good social
science.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1398-0
00:09:31.006 --> 00:09:35.334
And the these conversations and
these debates are are very least

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1398-1
00:09:35.334 --> 00:09:39.262
so if you so you, you you
probably you know from the after

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1398-2
00:09:39.262 --> 00:09:43.190
meeting you probably remember
your phone out you know what

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1398-3
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.318
does that mean by saying that
Realty and OK so on one hand we

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1398-4
00:09:47.318 --> 00:09:48.716
can say by diversity.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1461-0
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:53.113
Maybe walking colonization. We
want to have people, you know,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1461-1
00:09:53.113 --> 00:09:56.733
scholars from under
representative underrepresented

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1461-2
00:09:56.733 --> 00:10:00.911
social groups. But what they
really mean know why that make

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1461-3
00:10:00.911 --> 00:10:05.158
social life better. We actually
need a narrative or the need

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1461-4
00:10:05.158 --> 00:10:09.614
discussion about that instead of
just saying, you know, because

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1461-5
00:10:09.614 --> 00:10:13.861
that's why my I should study
this culture or or mine because

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1461-6
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:17.969
I promised cultural still my
analysis about his culture is

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1461-7
00:10:17.969 --> 00:10:18.596
positive.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1480-0
00:10:18.776 --> 00:10:23.080
Over authoritative or even
better, right? For instance, I

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1480-1
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.756
I'm not from China about, but
usually people will consider me.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1500-0
00:10:30.056 --> 00:10:32.478
And I thought it changed
politics. And when I go to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1500-1
00:10:32.478 --> 00:10:35.086
China, people, you should say,
well, you should listen.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1527-0
00:10:35.766 --> 00:10:39.883
Of these projects, China. But
the situation, yes, you have

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1527-1
00:10:39.883 --> 00:10:44.070
many, many foreign policies
about Chinese politics produced

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1527-2
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.326
by China scholars.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1628-0
00:10:46.506 --> 00:10:50.122
So yeah, so identity diversity
is the really tricky issue. On

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1628-1
00:10:50.122 --> 00:10:53.972
the one hand, we definitely know
the one with that person for you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1628-2
00:10:53.972 --> 00:10:57.705
know, the full 6 pedias analysis
by the end it anytime you know

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1628-3
00:10:57.705 --> 00:11:01.321
we need to make sure there is
some clear discussion about how

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1628-4
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:05.170
we can make suggest like better.
So that's why check the one that

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1628-5
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.903
actually spends the Met Workman.
He spent a lot of time talking

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1628-6
00:11:08.903 --> 00:11:12.403
about different biases and
eventually we're going to have a

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1628-7
00:11:12.403 --> 00:11:15.844
discussion about you know what
do you think about the bias

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1628-8
00:11:15.844 --> 00:11:16.136
body.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1659-0
00:11:16.556 --> 00:11:20.205
After you know it can be so many
different types of bias in

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1659-1
00:11:20.205 --> 00:11:23.794
Social Research, you think
yourself get your subject area,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1659-2
00:11:23.794 --> 00:11:26.896
you're subject area you comes
from is necessarily.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1711-0
00:11:27.846 --> 00:11:31.757
Better or more scientific? And
if you are trying to make the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1711-1
00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:35.668
argument by saying myself in
area belongs to social science,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1711-2
00:11:35.668 --> 00:11:39.066
what does that even mean? Right.
That's what we are.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1717-0
00:11:40.326 --> 00:11:42.846
Going to be doing it at the end
of today, right?

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1750-0
00:11:43.946 --> 00:11:47.890
So again, so just wait. Quick
history and objectives. So

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1750-1
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.111
again, message class was created
in years ago and we we need

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1750-2
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:55.156
master class you know OK this we
need this.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1813-0
00:11:55.286 --> 00:11:59.375
They found to allow and the
calling exploiting the sound of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1813-1
00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:03.669
the uncertain but cutting edge,
and the reason about you know,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1813-2
00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:07.962
what's Social Research and at
the same time, because we do not

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1813-3
00:12:07.962 --> 00:12:12.392
have enough college, we did not
have the capacity to teach a lot

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1813-4
00:12:12.392 --> 00:12:16.754
of research method models. So at
a time, you know what? What we

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1813-5
00:12:16.754 --> 00:12:19.276
were trying to do is we combine
the.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1819-0
00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:24.306
So each.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1835-0
00:12:27.416 --> 00:12:31.866
The cover of variety of research
methods and a discussion about

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1835-1
00:12:31.866 --> 00:12:33.326
Social Research. But.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1843-0
00:12:35.456 --> 00:12:37.726
Even though the methods would be
fine.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1881-0
00:12:40.706 --> 00:12:44.720
Research and actually also PG
people about Social Research on

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1881-1
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.864
the module when it was created.
It is overall when you research

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1881-2
00:12:48.864 --> 00:12:52.684
poster where there's student
above it because as I say, we

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1881-3
00:12:52.684 --> 00:12:56.568
want to be research across
America students the opportunity

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1881-4
00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:57.216
to expose.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1894-0
00:12:57.966 --> 00:13:01.707
This new methods that they can
remain competitive in the job

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1894-1
00:13:01.707 --> 00:13:02.136
market.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1896-0
00:13:03.036 --> 00:13:03.656
So.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1905-0
00:13:04.456 --> 00:13:09.216
But things have changed because
it came in 10 years, right?

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1938-0
00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:20.258
You know very longer lower every
time. There's so many scholars

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1938-1
00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:24.582
across different departments and
that's what that's OK. But we

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1938-2
00:13:24.582 --> 00:13:28.906
have a lot since who can teach
math test. So this is the time.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/1946-0
00:13:32.996 --> 00:13:35.716
So I would find especially for
this year.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2003-0
00:13:35.786 --> 00:13:39.753
I said the way I think about the
masterclass is as follows.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2003-1
00:13:39.753 --> 00:13:43.587
First, we want to use the master
class to produce the new

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2003-2
00:13:43.587 --> 00:13:46.959
generation of social
researchers, and we also want

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2003-3
00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:50.860
people to the masterclass used
about 10 weeks to show some

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2003-4
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.563
communication and at the same
time to give you guys the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2003-5
00:13:54.563 --> 00:13:55.356
opportunity.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2031-0
00:13:56.286 --> 00:13:59.762
Took about critical talking
about some of the methods you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2031-1
00:13:59.762 --> 00:14:03.597
have learned from other modules,
but this discussion with me on

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2031-2
00:14:03.597 --> 00:14:04.376
Kerry out by.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2041-0
00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:09.519
Umm. College from outside the
Department of politics at the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2041-1
00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:09.936
moment.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2050-0
00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:13.730
Right. So in terms of the
organization, we're we're gonna

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2050-1
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.886
be.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2087-0
00:14:15.386 --> 00:14:19.073
But each week is going to be
divided into two different

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2087-1
00:14:19.073 --> 00:14:23.089
sessions. The first one is the
mass size of icon that master

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2087-2
00:14:23.089 --> 00:14:27.106
lecture theory. But really it's
just we have colleagues from

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2087-3
00:14:27.106 --> 00:14:29.476
different departments to cover
one.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2116-0
00:14:32.856 --> 00:14:36.306
And in the second part of the
Masterclass, it's really

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2116-1
00:14:36.306 --> 00:14:40.070
difficult going to a really
concrete, tangible exercise for

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2116-2
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.833
for each week, and I'm going to
show you guys on the weekly

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2116-3
00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:45.276
syllabus in the moment.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2158-0
00:14:46.346 --> 00:14:51.084
So if you are taking the
masterclass for credit, you must

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2158-1
00:14:51.084 --> 00:14:56.231
do both because I'm some of the
books are actually helping you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2158-2
00:14:56.231 --> 00:15:01.379
completely assessment the idea
is, you know, if you can follow

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2158-3
00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:03.176
us doing the workshop.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2189-0
00:15:04.156 --> 00:15:07.557
It's everything, you know, we
have to do you workshops. You

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2189-1
00:15:07.557 --> 00:15:11.072
actually don't need any extra
time until to to finish our the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2189-2
00:15:11.072 --> 00:15:13.566
assessment because we know that
they might.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2213-0
00:15:15.356 --> 00:15:19.641
Right, something but somewhat
break and which is found so

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2213-1
00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:23.853
yeah, so the the workshops are
specifically in here your

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2213-2
00:15:23.853 --> 00:15:24.666
system, OK.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2242-0
00:15:25.736 --> 00:15:30.942
And if you want just only the
only require you to attend the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2242-1
00:15:30.942 --> 00:15:36.575
first department, and given that
you got auditing first you go go

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2242-2
00:15:36.575 --> 00:15:40.416
and you have access to old
materials. Don't.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2248-0
00:15:41.236 --> 00:15:43.926
And but we are not going to take
you.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2266-0
00:15:45.176 --> 00:15:50.867
You're free to go. You're free
to come and also don't need to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2266-1
00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.886
submit any assessment.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2286-0
00:15:53.776 --> 00:15:56.815
OK. Because as I say, I think
for especially for research

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2286-1
00:15:56.815 --> 00:15:59.854
school separation students on
the main idea here is well,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2286-2
00:15:59.854 --> 00:16:01.216
first you should focus on.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2319-0
00:16:01.516 --> 00:16:04.631
And the this just need to
graduate, but at the same time

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2319-1
00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:07.854
you have the opportunity to
learn about new methods. And I

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2319-2
00:16:07.854 --> 00:16:11.352
also wanna say if you are going
to audit on the best classifier

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2319-3
00:16:11.352 --> 00:16:12.226
research report.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2325-0
00:16:12.756 --> 00:16:14.816
And at the post graduate.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2336-0
00:16:15.536 --> 00:16:18.313
Research post the greatest
student. OK, you should have a

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2336-1
00:16:18.313 --> 00:16:18.936
conversation.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2404-0
00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:24.679
You're so bad that may have
different ideas about, you know,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2404-1
00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:28.133
what is your parents? So
sometimes it's very common. That

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2404-2
00:16:28.133 --> 00:16:31.349
sounds supervisors good
suggested students focused on

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2404-3
00:16:31.349 --> 00:16:34.625
finishing their PC's this
instead of, you know, taking

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2404-4
00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:38.556
time to object. But eventually I
think you should be there should

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2404-5
00:16:38.556 --> 00:16:42.010
be a conversation between you
and your supervisor. Thinks

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2404-6
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.916
you're taking the message class.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2409-0
00:16:45.576 --> 00:16:46.936
You know, we got.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2415-0
00:16:49.356 --> 00:16:50.506
Taking that perfect.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2454-0
00:16:52.096 --> 00:16:55.540
Right. So in principle the
lecture series, which have

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2454-1
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.494
anything that we practically
have three blocks of two blocks.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2454-2
00:16:59.494 --> 00:17:02.937
So. So the first block will be
from the tentative and

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2454-3
00:17:02.937 --> 00:17:05.616
computational social science, so
we have.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2535-0
00:17:06.346 --> 00:17:10.237
Mostly in the weeks before the
week before the next week, after

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2535-1
00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:13.884
very maiden. Many of you have
came forward. Introduction to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2535-2
00:17:13.884 --> 00:17:17.714
that it's gonna have a really
nice, excellent discussion about

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2535-3
00:17:17.714 --> 00:17:21.483
service design and service in
Social Research. And after that

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2535-4
00:17:21.483 --> 00:17:25.313
I'm going to have a really long
technical production to social

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2535-5
00:17:25.313 --> 00:17:29.143
network analysis because a lot
of people have been saying, you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2535-6
00:17:29.143 --> 00:17:32.668
know, social networking is
really powerful tool for us to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2535-7
00:17:32.668 --> 00:17:36.316
understand the social world. But
it's a really messy messy.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2542-0
00:17:36.386 --> 00:17:38.036
Earlier in the sense that you
know you SC.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2544-0
00:17:39.366 --> 00:17:39.806
The field.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2604-0
00:17:40.436 --> 00:17:44.447
You will see people who do
physics in the field. You will

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2604-1
00:17:44.447 --> 00:17:48.458
see people who do computer
science in the field. You also

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2604-2
00:17:48.458 --> 00:17:52.469
see people from sociology,
political science and whatever

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2604-3
00:17:52.469 --> 00:17:56.826
areas to say. You know, these
are really, it's a really it's a

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2604-4
00:17:56.826 --> 00:18:01.183
really lively area such thing.
You know everybody can claim to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2604-5
00:18:01.183 --> 00:18:05.055
say that you can claim to be
part of the social network

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2604-6
00:18:05.055 --> 00:18:06.646
analysis field. So and.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2664-0
00:18:07.676 --> 00:18:11.715
That's what we are going to have
natural language processing and

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2664-1
00:18:11.715 --> 00:18:15.753
this is actually, you know, one
of the most exciting things even

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2664-2
00:18:15.753 --> 00:18:19.730
for me, because I this national
language processing is a method

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2664-3
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:23.085
such that we want to see, we
want to tease our useful

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2664-4
00:18:23.085 --> 00:18:26.751
informations from unstructured
text like Twitter or policy

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2664-5
00:18:26.751 --> 00:18:30.666
documents. And then recent years
well because for a long time.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2701-0
00:18:32.296 --> 00:18:36.267
It was specific example building
company, but I would say

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2701-1
00:18:36.267 --> 00:18:40.580
starting from three years ago a
lot of included scientists and

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2701-2
00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:45.031
social researchers draw picking
out the technology or technique.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2701-3
00:18:45.031 --> 00:18:49.276
For instance, actually 10 years
ago, one of the first papers.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2735-0
00:18:50.316 --> 00:18:54.386
Which apply this language
processing in political science

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2735-1
00:18:54.386 --> 00:18:58.596
is saying using the they they
use some social media data in

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2735-2
00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:02.806
China to study the dynamics of
media censorship, which are.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2764-0
00:19:03.546 --> 00:19:07.644
And they mention find out a
logical Jason ship in China by

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2764-1
00:19:07.644 --> 00:19:12.021
using really well at the time
was fancy, but now but it's it's

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2764-2
00:19:12.021 --> 00:19:12.646
actually.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2782-0
00:19:13.966 --> 00:19:17.401
Quite common not be used topic
modeling and other text analysis

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2782-1
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:20.406
tools to understand. You know
what kind of information.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2788-0
00:19:21.506 --> 00:19:24.336
So Doctor Love is actually.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2806-0
00:19:25.626 --> 00:19:28.448
One of the most incompetent,
reliable and most friendly

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2806-1
00:19:28.448 --> 00:19:30.766
person I've ever know about
natural language.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2831-0
00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:34.879
Because on when can you guys
listen to me? But he's actually

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2831-1
00:19:34.879 --> 00:19:38.399
going to give you guys a really
good feedback from about, you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2831-2
00:19:38.399 --> 00:19:41.351
know, what we really can't do
with natural language

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2831-3
00:19:41.351 --> 00:19:41.976
processing.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2840-0
00:19:59.296 --> 00:20:00.236
Once they were too young.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2842-0
00:20:01.876 --> 00:20:02.446
You know.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2849-0
00:20:02.546 --> 00:20:05.856
You know that college kids ohgi.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2854-0
00:20:06.436 --> 00:20:08.216
OK, good. Have Joker, but data
science.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2869-0
00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:12.292
Alright, we're not errors and
then yeah, and then we have

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2869-1
00:20:12.292 --> 00:20:15.036
critical qualitative Social
Research and it is.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2886-0
00:20:16.496 --> 00:20:21.120
So hopefully you know I I think
it's a really exciting here

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2886-1
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.816
because we managed to.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2919-0
00:20:23.996 --> 00:20:27.580
Maximize the expertise in terms
of Social Research and

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2919-1
00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:31.490
development, and by seeing the
list of features. I hope you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2919-2
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:35.334
know I can send out the message
so you know one thing, but

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2919-3
00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:38.006
breakfast? I should really
strong place.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2960-0
00:20:39.236 --> 00:20:43.526
Even though we are not that big
compared with other similar

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2960-1
00:20:43.526 --> 00:20:48.103
colleges or universities or in
London, but we actually applied,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2960-2
00:20:48.103 --> 00:20:52.751
you know, in the research and I
hope you enjoyed the discussion.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2960-3
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:56.326
And I also want to remind you
one thing which is.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2966-0
00:20:58.146 --> 00:21:00.426
Each speaker each week.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2981-0
00:21:01.156 --> 00:21:04.231
They have the discretion to
decide how they wanted to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2981-1
00:21:04.231 --> 00:21:05.256
deliver materials.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/2986-0
00:21:05.896 --> 00:21:08.366
So it's going to be.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3007-0
00:21:09.056 --> 00:21:11.466
Very different from other
modules you have done, because

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3007-1
00:21:11.466 --> 00:21:14.046
I've been the other modules
probably is clear that you have.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3034-0
00:21:16.546 --> 00:21:21.033
We need to discussion. It is
nothing like that format, but

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3034-1
00:21:21.033 --> 00:21:24.836
you know, as I said for the week
on week numbers.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3116-0
00:21:25.376 --> 00:21:29.047
Not going to be any reply
reading, but Doctor Penny learns

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3116-1
00:21:29.047 --> 00:21:32.905
conclusion tonight that she's
going to design, you know, many

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3116-2
00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:36.887
activities to push you back to
think about on the pros and cons

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3116-3
00:21:36.887 --> 00:21:40.744
of methods and forward the next
week very maiden I think he's

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3116-4
00:21:40.744 --> 00:21:44.291
going to combine different
professional videos of videos

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3116-5
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:47.837
and the in class activity
parties. So I would definitely

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3116-6
00:21:47.837 --> 00:21:51.446
be open minded and be ready to
get surprised because need

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3116-7
00:21:51.446 --> 00:21:55.055
because if it's the kind of
modules you should not expect

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3116-8
00:21:55.055 --> 00:21:55.366
that.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3149-0
00:21:55.506 --> 00:21:59.314
For weeks to be the same. If
eventually you know you're

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3149-1
00:21:59.314 --> 00:22:03.531
feeling, you're common to the
class is always feel again with

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3149-2
00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:07.884
actually my favor. Do I need and
afford a workshop? And I think

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3149-3
00:22:07.884 --> 00:22:08.496
I'm just.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3240-0
00:22:09.716 --> 00:22:13.063
They are not like you know,
really, you know, ambiguous

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3240-1
00:22:13.063 --> 00:22:16.648
percussion about, you know,
whatever field that whatever of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3240-2
00:22:16.648 --> 00:22:20.055
my schooling. And so you're
research. So next week we're

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3240-3
00:22:20.055 --> 00:22:23.939
going to talk about how each of
you research on social media and

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3240-4
00:22:23.939 --> 00:22:27.704
the more traditional tool for
that is even though there's some

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3240-5
00:22:27.704 --> 00:22:31.349
point. I feel like it is 23
people probably don't use blocks

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3240-6
00:22:31.349 --> 00:22:35.055
anymore. So at some point I was
thinking about maybe I should

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3240-7
00:22:35.055 --> 00:22:38.640
change the assessment to say
instead of writing an academic

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3240-8
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.716
blog, please do a.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3244-0
00:22:40.216 --> 00:22:40.956
Twitter threat?

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3274-0
00:22:42.906 --> 00:22:46.556
Or yeah, it's actually it's not
easy to do that if you if you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3274-1
00:22:46.556 --> 00:22:50.324
have the opportunity to follow
scholars on Twitter and a lot of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3274-2
00:22:50.324 --> 00:22:53.856
that actually went very, very
good extended Twitter thread.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3290-0
00:22:54.686 --> 00:22:58.456
Who you know, to either to
showcase their research, you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3290-1
00:22:58.456 --> 00:23:01.216
engage in some really important
debates.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3344-0
00:23:01.996 --> 00:23:05.748
Or just to promote some ideas to
make a point. It's actually

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3344-1
00:23:05.748 --> 00:23:09.439
there has been some really
complicated discussion about how

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3344-2
00:23:09.439 --> 00:23:13.437
we should do that, especially if
you are close to graduation. As

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3344-3
00:23:13.437 --> 00:23:17.435
a patient student, you are going
to be on the job market. I just

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3344-4
00:23:17.435 --> 00:23:21.064
realized if you are going to be
on the job market as a PhD

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3344-5
00:23:21.064 --> 00:23:21.556
student.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3352-0
00:23:22.336 --> 00:23:24.466
You must have a Twitter account.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3373-0
00:23:25.326 --> 00:23:29.053
Because I actually did not start
using Twitter, you know, HD and

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3373-1
00:23:29.053 --> 00:23:32.550
I want you, Twitter and realize,
wow, there's so many things

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3373-2
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.786
going on there. And I was like
behind.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3378-0
00:23:35.656 --> 00:23:37.036
Everybody follow up about.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3396-0
00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:42.022
Five or six years, so and we are
also coming for two weeks to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3396-1
00:23:42.022 --> 00:23:45.675
talk about artificial
intelligence and theories and

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3396-2
00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:45.956
but.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3433-0
00:23:46.756 --> 00:23:50.355
We three and week four are big
different in the sense that week

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3433-1
00:23:50.355 --> 00:23:54.010
three is going to be mostly you
know to give you guys some ideas

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3433-2
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.216
about you know why we see a I
would computational fluid.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3487-0
00:23:58.586 --> 00:24:02.144
Social Research. So we're just
going to, you know, brainstorm

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3487-1
00:24:02.144 --> 00:24:05.645
some ideas about, given your
research interests, how can you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3487-2
00:24:05.645 --> 00:24:09.203
apply different reaction? Was
all computational tool. But the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3487-3
00:24:09.203 --> 00:24:12.704
way it's a bit more specific
because I'm going to, I'm going

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3487-4
00:24:12.704 --> 00:24:16.376
to we're going to participate in
the really exciting discussion

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3487-5
00:24:16.376 --> 00:24:17.926
the discussion that no one.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3499-0
00:24:18.956 --> 00:24:22.246
Has the final say, which is how
we use ChatGPT.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3518-0
00:24:23.286 --> 00:24:27.103
With your research not to help
you finish the assessment, by

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3518-1
00:24:27.103 --> 00:24:31.046
the way, I don't wanna say one
thing. I'm totally the college.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3523-0
00:24:31.716 --> 00:24:32.966
Has come up with a.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3526-0
00:24:33.926 --> 00:24:34.786
Algorithm.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3601-0
00:24:35.486 --> 00:24:39.000
To detect artificial
intelligence or ChatGPT writing

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3601-1
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.178
writing in your assessment and
the. But the conclusion for now

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3601-2
00:24:43.178 --> 00:24:47.157
I can this is like the coming
now, but we don't really know

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3601-3
00:24:47.157 --> 00:24:51.136
how to do that because even
though you can come up with the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3601-4
00:24:51.136 --> 00:24:55.512
ovaries and to say, OK, for this
particular apt, 38% of the text,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3601-5
00:24:55.512 --> 00:24:59.889
things like to be written by the
machine, but we don't have power

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3601-6
00:24:59.889 --> 00:25:00.486
evidence.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3649-0
00:25:01.236 --> 00:25:04.767
The company who invented the
algorithm or the college who

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3649-1
00:25:04.767 --> 00:25:08.419
introduced us to the algorithm,
they both say, you know, we

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3649-2
00:25:08.419 --> 00:25:12.011
should not take that as a heart
happen to save students or

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3649-3
00:25:12.011 --> 00:25:14.446
community and pleasure. ISM. But
still.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3668-0
00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:18.349
I'm looking for the captivity to
doctor and say, you know, it's a

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3668-1
00:25:18.349 --> 00:25:22.038
nightmare or two and academics
or even researchers, but we also

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3668-2
00:25:22.038 --> 00:25:22.326
have.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3711-0
00:25:23.126 --> 00:25:26.572
The manager of scholars know who
are trying to say, maybe we can

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3711-1
00:25:26.572 --> 00:25:29.805
see things and more or less
constructive way you're positive

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3711-2
00:25:29.805 --> 00:25:33.251
way by saying we want to use for
research, for protection. So we

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3711-3
00:25:33.251 --> 00:25:36.326
for ready for that we are going
to I'm going to you know.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3716-0
00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:40.776
Really short.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3719-0
00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:41.916
Bye.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3721-0
00:25:43.186 --> 00:25:43.806
Thank you.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3756-0
00:25:45.316 --> 00:25:48.515
I don't remember where things,
but I think it's from your

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3756-1
00:25:48.515 --> 00:25:51.880
university is in the management
school because what the what

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3756-2
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.245
that professor trying to do is
trying to, you know introduce

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3756-3
00:25:55.245 --> 00:25:55.686
chapter.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3810-0
00:25:55.886 --> 00:25:59.228
The last official component is
modeled to tell students you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3810-1
00:25:59.228 --> 00:26:02.681
must use chat TBT to complete
the requirements of this class,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3810-2
00:26:02.681 --> 00:26:06.189
which is weird, which is kind of
like I don't really know, but

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3810-3
00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:09.642
it's up to you. So let's talk
about that. That's the idea for

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3810-4
00:26:09.642 --> 00:26:13.095
the message question because I
don't really know what's going

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3810-5
00:26:13.095 --> 00:26:15.546
on, but I do think this kind of
discussion.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3877-0
00:26:17.016 --> 00:26:20.870
First, we should have and you
guys are ready to have given

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3877-1
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:24.724
that you have home Social
Research students. You have done

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3877-2
00:26:24.724 --> 00:26:28.513
so much so far to be here and
for week five. I don't talk

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3877-3
00:26:28.513 --> 00:26:32.433
about communication research,
especially we're going to use

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3877-4
00:26:32.433 --> 00:26:36.287
this week to talk about the
situation and with the service

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3877-5
00:26:36.287 --> 00:26:39.684
is going to be about
transparency and open. So just

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3877-6
00:26:39.684 --> 00:26:43.604
open social science because we
recently just don't know. We

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3877-7
00:26:43.604 --> 00:26:46.086
have been having a lot of
references.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3895-0
00:26:46.246 --> 00:26:50.828
Process. Of course the socket
area, even though I will say the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3895-1
00:26:50.828 --> 00:26:53.956
area that was affected most is
psychology.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3916-0
00:26:54.576 --> 00:26:57.648
Your sychology has been running
into a lot of, you know,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3916-1
00:26:57.648 --> 00:27:00.236
credibility crisis in even
though econometrics.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3918-0
00:27:00.316 --> 00:27:00.646
I'm.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3925-0
00:27:03.476 --> 00:27:05.706
Similar probability crisis about
India.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3927-0
00:27:06.786 --> 00:27:07.156
Thank you.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3929-0
00:27:07.286 --> 00:27:07.696
No.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3950-0
00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:14.180
Yeah. So we're gonna see
something about transparency

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3950-1
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:18.306
myself with that. We will meet
our tangible outcome.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3985-0
00:27:19.056 --> 00:27:22.199
Coming from that workshop would
be, you know, maybe to give you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3985-1
00:27:22.199 --> 00:27:25.195
guys a sense about what is pre
analysis like why some people

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3985-2
00:27:25.195 --> 00:27:28.192
say, you know, we should do pre
analysis before you even say

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/3985-3
00:27:28.192 --> 00:27:31.286
complete your research. We're
going to talk about some of the.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4005-0
00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:36.381
Proposals like some of the
initiatives are proposed by

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4005-1
00:27:36.381 --> 00:27:40.236
scholars in Europe and North
America about how we can.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4033-0
00:27:41.806 --> 00:27:44.704
Make sure you know the
credibility or transparency of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4033-1
00:27:44.704 --> 00:27:47.977
your Social Research instead of
your interface. Maybe I went

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4033-2
00:27:47.977 --> 00:27:51.412
down to receiving you to do 10
different interviews and it gets

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4033-3
00:27:51.412 --> 00:27:52.056
my research.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4074-0
00:27:53.836 --> 00:27:58.255
I I want to make one thing when
you talk about transparency and

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4074-1
00:27:58.255 --> 00:28:02.605
openness, social science, it's
not just a matter of four quant

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4074-2
00:28:02.605 --> 00:28:06.610
Social Research, qualitative
Social Research actually has

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4074-3
00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:09.786
been subject to unlock a lot of
participants.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4109-0
00:28:10.986 --> 00:28:14.243
Because as you as you remember
from the first chapter, somebody

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4109-1
00:28:14.243 --> 00:28:16.889
would even say fine, the
interviews we do, it's not

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4109-2
00:28:16.889 --> 00:28:19.638
worthy. But if you know
something about the course, I

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4109-3
00:28:19.638 --> 00:28:21.826
think we have some of those
students here.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4118-0
00:28:23.346 --> 00:28:25.126
I'm thinking the paper is not
here saying.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4124-0
00:28:27.156 --> 00:28:29.226
And why should I take?

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4133-0
00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:32.826
Whatever you got from the
interview is for friends.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4175-0
00:28:33.736 --> 00:28:38.133
Right. Is there any procedure
that we can, you know make sure

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4175-1
00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:42.531
you analysis is rigorous or even
we can replicate analysis of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4175-2
00:28:42.531 --> 00:28:46.502
interview data that is a really
crazy idea and American

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4175-3
00:28:46.502 --> 00:28:50.829
political science distribution
effect on they were trying to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4175-4
00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:53.666
come up with a proposal by
saying well.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4208-0
00:28:53.866 --> 00:28:57.189
All those little scholars, you
know, staff, workers or

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4208-1
00:28:57.189 --> 00:29:01.057
interviews, or however been such
histories, whatever, they also

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4208-2
00:29:01.057 --> 00:29:04.864
have to submit a report on how
to how much degree other people

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4208-3
00:29:04.864 --> 00:29:06.556
can replicate their results.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4236-0
00:29:07.356 --> 00:29:11.167
I don't know how do I replicate
the same results by reading the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4236-1
00:29:11.167 --> 00:29:14.739
same interview transcript. We
don't know. So the discussion

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4236-2
00:29:14.739 --> 00:29:17.776
really heated. Eventually, I
don't think we had a.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4282-0
00:29:18.846 --> 00:29:21.985
We got conclusion, but I'm going
to introduce some of the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4282-1
00:29:21.985 --> 00:29:25.070
debates, you know, like
different styles, because it was

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4282-2
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.587
a really, really, really fierce
debate between different people.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4282-3
00:29:28.587 --> 00:29:31.943
But we're going to do something
that's best to you for you to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4282-4
00:29:31.943 --> 00:29:34.757
think about it because
eventually, here's the thing

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4282-5
00:29:34.757 --> 00:29:37.896
about confirmation search.
Nothing we do will be perfect.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4303-0
00:29:39.196 --> 00:29:42.611
But eventually, as Matt Grossman
put in the first chapter, the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4303-1
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:44.726
best thing we can do is probably
just.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4329-0
00:29:45.426 --> 00:29:50.633
Recognize we have bias and try
our best to mitigate our lives.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4329-1
00:29:50.633 --> 00:29:53.196
And finally for weeks 8 and 11.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4336-0
00:29:56.056 --> 00:29:57.556
And we are going to.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4360-0
00:29:58.436 --> 00:30:03.011
Create a setting similar to a
formal academic conference. So

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4360-1
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:07.511
we are going to present your
dissertation, which we'll talk

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4360-2
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:09.686
more about the details thing.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4391-0
00:30:10.986 --> 00:30:13.780
You're going to talk about your
dissertation and ohh other

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4391-1
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.715
research ideas. Depending on
what you're doing at the moment,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4391-2
00:30:16.715 --> 00:30:19.793
because I know not not everybody
is working on that station this

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4391-3
00:30:19.793 --> 00:30:22.776
moment, but the key thing for
the presentation that is not to.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4413-0
00:30:23.296 --> 00:30:26.859
Because we want to create a
constructive environment to make

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4413-1
00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:30.248
sure you know everybody is here
to help you, to make your

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4413-2
00:30:30.248 --> 00:30:31.416
dissertation better.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4422-0
00:30:32.406 --> 00:30:36.136
Right. So yeah, so something so
basically I'm.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4441-0
00:30:37.316 --> 00:30:42.419
Audience ready and send your
research for 610 minutes and I

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4441-1
00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:45.906
may, depending on how many
students are.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4464-0
00:30:46.546 --> 00:30:51.020
We have for workshops. I may
assign each student a discussion

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4464-1
00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.906
like you you like. In addition
with me.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4481-0
00:30:54.086 --> 00:30:58.699
In the 17 your research, you're
also going to be responsible for

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4481-1
00:30:58.699 --> 00:31:02.106
discussing the the research of
another student.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4503-0
00:31:03.016 --> 00:31:05.726
Just to give you guys the
opportunity to to get a sense of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4503-1
00:31:05.726 --> 00:31:08.482
you know how like what kind of
things we do as researchers,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4503-2
00:31:08.482 --> 00:31:09.676
because we do that owners.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4511-0
00:31:09.766 --> 00:31:12.446
And it's not whenever.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4529-0
00:31:12.846 --> 00:31:17.330
You might be cuter of review. A
journal article, or when I was

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4529-1
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:21.173
invited to discuss someone's
research in the academic

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4529-2
00:31:21.173 --> 00:31:21.956
conference.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4572-0
00:31:22.516 --> 00:31:25.645
Umm, actually have to talk to my
supervisor. I have to talk to my

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4572-1
00:31:25.645 --> 00:31:28.775
supervisor for three hours about
because he's he. He actually did

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4572-2
00:31:28.775 --> 00:31:31.525
a really long list of things
about, you know, OK, this is

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4572-3
00:31:31.525 --> 00:31:34.370
what you should do. This is
probably what it should do. And

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4572-4
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:37.262
at some point, you know, you
want to be critical, but if you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4572-5
00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:39.586
don't want to become sending,
you don't want to.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4631-0
00:31:41.126 --> 00:31:44.427
You know, it's not like because
you don't want to just destroy

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4631-1
00:31:44.427 --> 00:31:47.623
that person, even though you
know, as you see, you know, for

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4631-2
00:31:47.623 --> 00:31:50.976
for, for many decades, they've
me or the research community can

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4631-3
00:31:50.976 --> 00:31:53.963
be really toxic, right? People
sometimes, you know, even

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4631-4
00:31:53.963 --> 00:31:57.054
students or even scholars say,
you know, I'm not afraid of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4631-5
00:31:57.054 --> 00:31:59.936
saying something because I'm
proud of saying something

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4631-6
00:31:59.936 --> 00:32:03.289
stupid. You know, other people
would think they better. But I I

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4631-7
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:04.966
I think I want to overturn that.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4645-0
00:32:07.426 --> 00:32:10.886
Yeah, I just by showing you guys
this so.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4669-0
00:32:12.116 --> 00:32:15.991
Constructive and positive way to
do that, that is actually, you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4669-1
00:32:15.991 --> 00:32:19.684
know, the difference between the
East and West Coast and the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4669-2
00:32:19.684 --> 00:32:23.256
right of record. So about your
assessment of your segment.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4684-0
00:32:24.326 --> 00:32:27.458
Because they're basically, you
would have Charlotte, even

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4684-1
00:32:27.458 --> 00:32:29.186
though they are three different.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4695-0
00:32:30.326 --> 00:32:33.706
Assessment. But ideally speaking
on if.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4703-0
00:32:34.606 --> 00:32:36.756
Uh, how should I put it the
first of two?

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4711-0
00:32:36.836 --> 00:32:40.806
So that's like something we call
formative assessment.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4781-0
00:32:42.046 --> 00:32:46.575
Because in the first attempting
this tell you really. So these

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4781-1
00:32:46.575 --> 00:32:50.961
are basically, you know, asking
you to write down the course

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4781-2
00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:55.562
feature 2 lectures. And ideally
once you from the weeks between

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4781-3
00:32:55.562 --> 00:32:59.732
two and five like from the
computational and the and. And

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4781-4
00:32:59.732 --> 00:33:04.046
the second lecture should come
from qualitative and history

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4781-5
00:33:04.046 --> 00:33:06.706
weeks, OK and for presentation
on 2.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4795-0
00:33:08.906 --> 00:33:12.267
You're supposed to submit your
or upload your presentation

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4795-1
00:33:12.267 --> 00:33:12.666
slides.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4849-0
00:33:13.706 --> 00:33:18.006
And if I was going to write a
critical reflection paper based

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4849-1
00:33:18.006 --> 00:33:22.167
on your blog post and also based
on documentation because I

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4849-2
00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:26.259
specifically asking you to do
three things in the critical

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4849-3
00:33:26.259 --> 00:33:30.489
reflection paper first to do the
summary of the research you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4849-4
00:33:30.489 --> 00:33:34.096
present and the second talk
about how any lectures.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4926-0
00:33:34.236 --> 00:33:38.305
I would like to class helping
you think about your research. I

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4926-1
00:33:38.305 --> 00:33:41.663
did you say? Ohh. Maybe I can
use this method in my

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4926-2
00:33:41.663 --> 00:33:45.408
dissertation even though I
probably don't know very much.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4926-3
00:33:45.408 --> 00:33:49.154
And finally have every any
comments critique you received

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4926-4
00:33:49.154 --> 00:33:53.287
when you present your research.
So as you can see they actually

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4926-5
00:33:53.287 --> 00:33:57.485
combine that actually will build
upon each other tightly closely

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4926-6
00:33:57.485 --> 00:34:01.231
with with each other even though
there are three separate

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4926-7
00:34:01.231 --> 00:34:03.556
assessments. Like actually get
one.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4952-0
00:34:04.626 --> 00:34:08.367
And the reason why, in fact,
it's more like this is because I

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4952-1
00:34:08.367 --> 00:34:12.290
want to. I want you guys to get
something from masterclass. Also

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4952-2
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:13.316
I want to reduce.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4978-0
00:34:14.586 --> 00:34:17.893
The workload as much as
possible, because this is the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4978-1
00:34:17.893 --> 00:34:21.691
summer term, your priorities
should be your dissertation, but

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4978-2
00:34:21.691 --> 00:34:23.896
and hopefully you have been
having.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4993-0
00:34:24.866 --> 00:34:27.737
Interesting and active
conversations, which were

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4993-1
00:34:27.737 --> 00:34:30.256
dissertations supervisor
hopefully, right.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4995-0
00:34:34.586 --> 00:34:34.916
Well.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/4998-0
00:34:35.836 --> 00:34:36.486
Send it.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5016-0
00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:41.679
But I think ohh I did not ohk OK
I took all the one I have two

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5016-1
00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:42.656
out of 1 limit.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5066-0
00:34:42.736 --> 00:34:46.598
It's between 101,000. It meant
to be very short. Yeah. So we're

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5066-1
00:34:46.598 --> 00:34:49.917
going to keep you with two
workshop because I what I'm

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5066-2
00:34:49.917 --> 00:34:53.537
going to do next week is I'm
going to give you guys. I hand

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5066-3
00:34:53.537 --> 00:34:57.339
out. That was the list of things
that you have to cover in the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5066-4
00:34:57.339 --> 00:35:00.959
blog post and we are going to
use Doctor Barry, maintenance

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5066-5
00:35:00.959 --> 00:35:02.166
lecture as exercise.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5074-0
00:35:02.966 --> 00:35:04.706
Yeah. So we are going to see a
very.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5125-0
00:35:05.536 --> 00:35:09.626
Specific list of things you have
to do in your blog post and if

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5125-1
00:35:09.626 --> 00:35:13.524
you go to Moodle I'll upload
some of the examples from other

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5125-2
00:35:13.524 --> 00:35:17.294
university or other Research
Institute because it's on one

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5125-3
00:35:17.294 --> 00:35:21.256
hand. Yes, it's getting common
to use academic logs to cover.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5159-0
00:35:21.416 --> 00:35:25.423
Are you doing research for any
other research activities? Even,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5159-1
00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:29.242
but at the same time, I think
it's also important to to make

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5159-2
00:35:29.242 --> 00:35:33.249
sure you guys are aware that we
actually have new formats that,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5159-3
00:35:33.249 --> 00:35:34.626
but either you can do.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5200-0
00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:41.574
Like you say, I have some people
like they just, you know,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5200-1
00:35:41.574 --> 00:35:45.199
create, take talk of no tick
tock on channels and feature

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5200-2
00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:49.325
there research in, I don't know,
30 seconds. I I think it's gonna

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5200-3
00:35:49.325 --> 00:35:53.201
be too much to ask you do that
though. I just want to let you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5200-4
00:35:53.201 --> 00:35:55.576
know you know there are so many
ways.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5202-0
00:35:56.156 --> 00:35:56.416
Each.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5217-0
00:35:58.226 --> 00:36:01.076
And publishing your research as
journal articles, I think that's

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5217-1
00:36:01.076 --> 00:36:01.646
more or less.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5238-0
00:36:03.946 --> 00:36:07.423
Ohh patiently I think what you
know. Probably pretty colors,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5238-1
00:36:07.423 --> 00:36:10.730
all the young television have
tried to come out with many

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5238-2
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.896
different creative channels
platform.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5264-0
00:36:13.336 --> 00:36:17.559
You can't say that he's not for
to get attention or whatever

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5264-1
00:36:17.559 --> 00:36:22.128
they want. And then there's also
the different to, you know, show

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5264-2
00:36:22.128 --> 00:36:24.136
videos. There's also podcast.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5275-0
00:36:24.896 --> 00:36:27.456
Yeah. We begin to see actually
that the student to do podcast.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5282-0
00:36:28.156 --> 00:36:29.986
And there's also what else?

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5313-0
00:36:31.736 --> 00:36:34.668
Right there, there should be
more just because I don't know,

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5313-1
00:36:34.668 --> 00:36:37.456
maybe you can also create an
envision, but I just want to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5313-2
00:36:37.456 --> 00:36:40.243
know there are interested like
they're actually different

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5313-3
00:36:40.243 --> 00:36:42.166
creative ways to to to produce
content.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5362-0
00:36:44.256 --> 00:36:47.856
Other people's research and we
are going to spend next week to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5362-1
00:36:47.856 --> 00:36:51.171
to think through some of the
options and hopefully we can

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5362-2
00:36:51.171 --> 00:36:54.085
talk about you know the
advantage and advantage of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5362-3
00:36:54.085 --> 00:36:57.400
different formats. But most
specifically you know there's

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5362-4
00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.086
going to be an exercise to help
you with that.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5377-0
00:37:01.506 --> 00:37:07.021
And so hopefully that answers
the question. And so I'm going

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5377-1
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:08.016
to rewrite.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5384-0
00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:10.676
During the lecture series, even
if.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5395-0
00:37:11.976 --> 00:37:15.466
Here to 1st to introduce you
guys to.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5430-0
00:37:16.416 --> 00:37:20.101
On the speaker, I'm also
introduced the speaker to you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5430-1
00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:24.055

00:37:24.055 --> 00:37:27.808
the full match will be really
similar to you. A typical

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5430-3
00:37:27.808 --> 00:37:30.086
research talk or research
events.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5438-0
00:37:30.766 --> 00:37:33.756
Taking place in other colleges
of inverse.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5462-0
00:37:34.906 --> 00:37:38.558
Just because I want to give you
that, you know, in addition to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5462-1
00:37:38.558 --> 00:37:42.211
you in the format is also very
important. So you know you know

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5462-2
00:37:42.211 --> 00:37:44.936
in your typical homework
research talking how.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5484-0
00:37:46.746 --> 00:37:50.557
People with different rules
interacting together, right? And

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5484-1
00:37:50.557 --> 00:37:54.244
I'm also going to read the
workshop, and I'm also going to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5484-2
00:37:54.244 --> 00:37:55.806

And I'm also going to be
available.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5504-0
00:38:07.566 --> 00:38:09.976
So feel free to use my and if
you.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5506-0
00:38:10.056 --> 00:38:10.546
You know.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5536-0
00:38:11.576 --> 00:38:15.538
You'll have to send me e-mail
and I will see what I can do and

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5536-1
00:38:15.538 --> 00:38:19.248
if you want to know more about
my office or policy, please

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5536-2
00:38:19.248 --> 00:38:20.506
refer to the module.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5561-0
00:38:21.566 --> 00:38:25.463
Right. So which means, you know,
we want to be, you know, as

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5561-1
00:38:25.463 --> 00:38:29.296
accessible as possible, you
guys. So at some point when you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5561-2
00:38:29.296 --> 00:38:31.916
feel like you are being lost,
hopefully.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5574-0
00:38:32.946 --> 00:38:34.946
I mean, I know because
sometimes, you know, the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5574-1
00:38:34.946 --> 00:38:36.196
students were few of you lost.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5601-0
00:38:37.416 --> 00:38:40.841
Can you? But if you wait until
we 11 then or wait 10 still feel

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5601-1
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:44.160
the same then you know I think
we need to talk about you know

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5601-2
00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.836
why how come you're not using it
properly anyway.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5634-0
00:38:47.456 --> 00:38:51.705
Right. So the plan for next
week, so next week, very meeting

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5634-1
00:38:51.705 --> 00:38:55.885
Doctor Barry Maydom politics.
It's about service design for

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5634-2
00:38:55.885 --> 00:39:00.274
the research. He's done a lot of
survey project, especially in

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5634-3
00:39:00.274 --> 00:39:03.896
global styles including
countries in Latin America.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5636-0
00:39:05.746 --> 00:39:06.316
So.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5693-0
00:39:07.506 --> 00:39:11.199
The question about because we
know service are really common

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5693-1
00:39:11.199 --> 00:39:14.893
too, but service also one of the
very notorious tools in the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5693-2
00:39:14.893 --> 00:39:18.526
sense that there are so many
things about you not know this

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5693-3
00:39:18.526 --> 00:39:22.219
until you do that by yourself
and pull this way, even though

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5693-4
00:39:22.219 --> 00:39:25.973
you can't feel more than they
they would give you some really

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5693-5
00:39:25.973 --> 00:39:29.606
generic principles of survey
design or survey analysis. But

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5693-6
00:39:29.606 --> 00:39:31.786
really because you're dealing
with.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5757-0
00:39:33.906 --> 00:39:37.316
Whenever you're trying to deal
with people, you know, The thing

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5757-1
00:39:37.316 --> 00:39:40.512
is, you know, I mean, there's
some great things that can go

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5757-2
00:39:40.512 --> 00:39:43.815
wrong, and it is so wrong in
front of you and we need to find

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5757-3
00:39:43.815 --> 00:39:47.172
some way to to, to address that.
And so usually it's it's very

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5757-4
00:39:47.172 --> 00:39:50.475
good if you can have a really
experienced every researcher of

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5757-5
00:39:50.475 --> 00:39:52.446
researchers, you talk about
service.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5791-0
00:39:53.116 --> 00:39:56.954
They don't want a new PhD to
talk about service like we. So

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5791-1
00:39:56.954 --> 00:40:01.111
Doctor Berry maintains the right
person and we also going to use

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5791-2
00:40:01.111 --> 00:40:03.286
the workshop to have an
exercise.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5834-0
00:40:03.386 --> 00:40:07.696
Like 30 drop. So I would say the
please finish are really free.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5834-1
00:40:07.696 --> 00:40:11.332
LSE Post on the poster was I
think was written by LSE

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5834-2
00:40:11.332 --> 00:40:15.507
Knowledge Exchange Commission
and working in analytic. Before

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5834-3
00:40:15.507 --> 00:40:18.066
I came here. So that's why
sometimes.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5843-0
00:40:22.596 --> 00:40:25.096
But I think they actually lay
out.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5849-0
00:40:27.756 --> 00:40:29.086
And that's that's where we're
going.

00:40:31.576 --> 00:40:35.590
Fashion and exercise to help you
guys complete. You know, one

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5867-1
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.986
blog to feature Doctor Barry
Maydom.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5876-0
00:40:39.956 --> 00:40:43.276
Electric and because I'm also
thinking about.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5904-0
00:40:45.346 --> 00:40:49.328
We need to talk about this next
week, but I'm just thinking

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5904-1
00:40:49.328 --> 00:40:52.912
about using some blocks to
feature your blocks on the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5904-2
00:40:52.912 --> 00:40:54.306
Social Research blog.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5959-0
00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:59.211
So you will have the opportunity
to get this thing by everybody.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5959-1
00:40:59.211 --> 00:41:02.834
Bye. Bye. That's my point. I I'm
still trying to decide the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5959-2
00:41:02.834 --> 00:41:06.518
platform because at above like
we have a couple of different

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5959-3
00:41:06.518 --> 00:41:10.383
ones. So we have one block for
further school. We also have one

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5959-4
00:41:10.383 --> 00:41:14.187
block just for Social Research.
We also have one block for the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5959-5
00:41:14.187 --> 00:41:15.576
Department of Politics.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5994-0
00:41:16.306 --> 00:41:20.033
So I'm still trying to decide
which one. Maybe I can give your

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5994-1
00:41:20.033 --> 00:41:23.582
input, but eventually the idea
is you know, we want to make

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5994-2
00:41:23.582 --> 00:41:27.013
sure you know on the one hand
you have the opportunity to

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/5994-3
00:41:27.013 --> 00:41:27.546
exercise.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/6010-0
00:41:28.576 --> 00:41:31.957
Let me blocking for the Alison
time. You'll have the

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/6010-1
00:41:31.957 --> 00:41:34.126
opportunity to be seen by
others.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/6012-0
00:41:34.866 --> 00:41:35.576
OK.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/6015-0
00:41:36.766 --> 00:41:37.976
Right. So.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/6035-0
00:41:39.426 --> 00:41:42.442
No, I've done so. I'm going to
stop the recording and then

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/6035-1
00:41:42.442 --> 00:41:45.560
since I'm going to follow up
because I need to listen to you

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/6035-2
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:45.816
guys.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/6043-0
00:41:46.916 --> 00:41:49.086
Right. So let me turn this off.

a322a894-5728-44d8-bf97-5d5dd6da7fba/6051-0
00:41:50.546 --> 00:41:52.136
If I can wait, how do I turn
this off?
