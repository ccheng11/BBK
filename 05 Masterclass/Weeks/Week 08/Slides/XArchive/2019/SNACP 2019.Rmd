## What is a network?

\begin{itemize}
  \item Network: Objects $+$ connections.
	\item Social network: People, ideas, countries, groups, etc. $+$ relationships.
	\item Complex social systems: Many different parts with strong interactions; collective behavior is surprising, hard to predict, namely "emergent."
\end{itemize}

## What is a network?

\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{network} (\textbf{graph}) is a composed of a set of objects, called \textbf{nodes} (or \textbf{vertices}), with some or all pairs of these objects connected by \textbf{ties} (\textbf{edges}).
	\item Two nodes are \textbf{neighbors} if they are connected.
\end{itemize}

## Basic types of networks (graphs)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Simple graph
  \item Weighted graph
  \item Directed graph
  \item Signed graph
\end{itemize}

## Basic types of networks: Simple graph

A network that has neither self-edges nor multiedges. That is, in addition to the definition above,
\begin{equation}
  A_{ii} = 0 \quad \forall \quad i.
\end{equation}

## Math representation of networks

The \textbf{adjacency matrix} or \textbf{sociomatrix} \textbf{A} of a graph (network) can be represented as an $n\times n$ matrix \textbf{A} such that
\begin{equation}
	A_{ij} =
	\begin{cases}
	1 & \text{if there exists an edge between $i$ and $j$}\\
	0 & \text{otherwise},
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $n$ refers to the number of \textbf{nodes}.

  5: \{1,3\}\\
  6: \{3\}\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

## Basic types of networks: Weighted graph

The adjacency matrix or sociomatrix \textbf{A} of a weighted network is an $n\times n$ matrix with elements
\begin{equation}
	A_{ij} =
	\begin{cases}
	r \in \mathbb{R} & \text{if there exists an edge between $i$ and $j$}\\
	0 & \text{otherwise},
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $n$ refers to the number of \textbf{nodes}.

## Basic types of networks: Directed graph

A directed network is a network in which edges have a direction, pointing from one vertex to another. The adjacency matrix \textbf{A} of a \textit{directed} graph is the matrix with elements
\begin{equation}
	A_{ij} =
	\begin{cases}
	1 & \text{if there exists an edge from $j$ and $i$}\\
	0 & \text{otherwise},
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $n$ refers to the number of \textbf{nodes}.

## More types of networks

\begin{itemize}
  \item Affiliation network (bipartite network and hypergraph);
  \begin{itemize}
  \item cocitation network (i.e., studies that are cited together in a study)
	\item bibliographic coupling network (i.e., studies that use the same references)
  \end{itemize}
	\item regular network (i.e., networks in which all nodes have the same degree);
	\item planar network (i.e., networks that can be visualized without any edges crossing each other);		
	\item tree and forest;
  \item ... and many more.
\end{itemize}

## Affiliation network

\begin{itemize}
  \item A \textbf{bipartite graph} is a graph in which there are two types of node, and edges only run between the two types.
  \item A \textbf{hypergraph} is a network in which edges can join two or more nodes.
\end{itemize}

## Two pillars of social network analysis (SNA)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Descriptive SNA: Study numerical summary measures of networks.
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \item Generative or inferential SNA: Study underlying dynamic process of network formation; hypothesis testing; simulation; Ergm.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA

\begin{itemize}
  \item Network connectivity;
  \begin{itemize}
	  \item degree
	  \item density
	  \item path and geodesic distance
	\end{itemize}
	\item node centrality: Measures of node importance in a network;
	\item ... and many more (e.g., cosine similarity, cliques, triads, and assortive mixing)
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Degree

Given an adjacency matrix \textbf{A}, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.
\begin{equation}
	k_i  = \sum_j^n A_{ij},
\end{equation}
where $n$ refers to the number of nodes in the graph.

## Descriptive SNA: Degree

A \textbf{regular} graph is one in which all nodes have the same degree.
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Figs/reg}
\end{figure}

## Descriptive SNA: Degree

The total number of edges in graph \textbf{A} will be
\begin{equation}
  2m = \sum_i^n k_i \quad \Rightarrow \quad m = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i^n k_i,
\end{equation}
where $k_i$ is the degree of node $i$ in the graph.

## Descriptive SNA: Degree

How do we derive the mean degree of graph \textbf{A}?
\begin{equation}
  c = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n k_i = \frac{2m}{n}.
\end{equation}

## Descriptive SNA: Density

\begin{itemize}
  \item The density of a graph measures the \textit{connectance} of a graph.
  \vspace{0.2cm}
	\item Mathematically, it is defined as the number of edges out of the max possible number of edges of a graph.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Density

The density of a graph is defined as the share of the number of edges out of the max possible number of edges of a graph.
<!-- \pause -->
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{m}{\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} = \frac{c}{n-1},
\end{equation}
Recall that $c = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n k_i = \frac{2m}{n}$, where $c$ is the mean degree.

## Descriptive SNA: Density

\begin{equation}
	\rho = \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{m}{\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} = \frac{c}{n-1}.
\end{equation}
<!-- \pause -->
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A network for which the density tends to a constant as the number of nodes tends to infinity is \textbf{dense}.
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item A network for which the density tends to 0 as the number of nodes tends to infinity is \textbf{sparse}.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

\begin{itemize}
		\item A \textbf{path} is a sequence of nodes with the property that each consecutive pair in the sequence is connected by an edge.
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		\item A \textbf{simple path} is a sequence of nodes with the property that each consecutive pair in the sequence is connected by an edge and each node in the sequence appears only once.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

\begin{itemize}
  \item In statistics, a path is also a \textbf{walk}.
  \item A \textbf{walk} of length $k$ between nodes $i$ and $j$ means that the path between $i$ and $j$ contains $k$ edges where $i\neq j$.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

\begin{itemize}
	\item Existence of \textit{walks} between nodes tell us about network connectivity.
	\item Existence of \textit{walks of minimal length} tells us about \textbf{geodesics}, or geodesic distance, between two nodes in the graph.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

The walks of all lengths between a pair of nodes can be counted using matrix multiplication. Define $W = A^k$, where $k$ means we multiply the adjacency matrix of graph \textbf{A} for $k$ times, then 
\begin{equation}
	W_{ij} = \text{the number of walks of length $k$ between $i$ and $j$.}	
\end{equation}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figs/path}
\end{figure}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

Define $X^{(k)}$, where $k = 1, \cdots, n-1$.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	& X^{1} = A \\
	& X^{2} = A + A^{2} \\
	& \vdots \\
	& X^{k} = A + A^{2} + A^{3} + \cdots + A^{k}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
		\item $X^{(1)}$ counts the number of walks of length 1 between nodes.
		\item $X^{(2)}$ counts the number of walks of length $\leq 2$ between nodes.
		\item $X^{(k)}$ counts the number of walks of length $\leq k$ between nodes.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

Altogether, we can define $d_{ij}$, the geodesic distance between $i$ and $j$, as follows. Recall a path is a walk.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	d_{ij} & = \text{length of the shortest path between $i$ and $j$} \\
	& = \text{length of the shortest walk between $i$ and $j$} \\
	& = \text{the first or min $k$ for which $A_{ij}^{k}>0$}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
\pause
\vspace{0.4cm}
Can you write a function in \texttt{R} to compute the geodesic distances for a graph \textbf{A}?

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

Centrality measures the \textit{importance} of each node in a network.

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

\textbf{Degree} centrality uses the degree of a vertex (i.e., the number of neighbors it has) to measure its importance in a graph.
\begin{equation}
	k_i = \sum_j^n A_{ij},
\end{equation}
where $n$ refers to the number of nodes in the graph.\
\vspace{0.3cm}
What is the caveat? \pause Degree centrality treats all neighbors as ``equal.''

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

\textbf{Eigenvector} centrality measures the influence of a node in a network by giving each vertex a score \textbf{proportional} to the sum of the scores of its neighbors.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	& x_i = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_j A_{ij}x_j \\
	\Rightarrow \quad & \textbf{Ax} = \lambda\textbf{x},
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the leading eigenvector of \textbf{A}.\
\vspace{0.3cm}
Why do we need eigenvector centrality?

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

\textbf{Closeness} centrality measures the importance of a node by calculating the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph.
\begin{equation}
	c_i = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{n} \sum_j d_{ij}} = \frac{n}{\sum_j d_{ij}},
\end{equation}
where $d_{ij}$ is the geodesic distance between $i$ and $j$.\
\vspace{0.3cm}
Use $n$ or $n-1$?  Should we consider the situation such that $i=j$? \pause Maybe not. A vertex's influence on itself is usually not our concern.

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

\textbf{Betweenness} centrality measures the importance of a node by considering how often a node sits on the paths between all other nodes in the graph.
\begin{equation}
	x_i = \sum \frac{\sigma_{ijk}}{\sigma_{jk}},
\end{equation}
where $i\neq j\neq k$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\sigma_{jk}$ refers to the number of shortest paths from $j$ to $k$.
	\item $\sigma_{ijk}$ refers to the number of those paths that pass through $i$.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.3cm}
Normalization? \pause One choice is to normalize the path count by dividing by the total number of vertex pairs (i.e., $n^2$).

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

A node in a graph can be important if
\begin{itemize}
	\item it connects to many other nodes in the graph;
	\item it connects to other nodes that connects to many other nodes in the graph;
	\item it is on the paths between many other nodes in the graph;
	\item it is on average close to many other nodes in the graph;
	\item ... and many more.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

\begin{itemize}
	\item Katz centrality (to avoid zero centrality).
	\item PageRank (designed by Google to avoid inappropriate high centrality).
	\item Hubs and authorities (by taking edge directions seriously; what makes a node more important -- a vertex has high centrality if those that point to it have high centrality OR a vertex high centrality if it points to others with high centrality?).
\end{itemize}

## Inferential SNA

We hope to specify a stochastic model to
\begin{itemize}
  \item understand the underlying dynamic social and interactive processes (e.g., assortative mixing) associated with the observed outcomes;
  \item test hypotheses based on different varieties of node and structural attributes;
  \item extrapolate and simulate from the specified model.
\end{itemize}

## Inferential SNA

For example: "clustering" typically observed in social nets can be a result of
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sociality: highly active persons create clusters.
  \item Homophily: assortative mixing by attribute creates clusters.
  \item Transitive triad closure: triangles create clusters.
\end{itemize}

## Inferential SNA: Exponential-family random graph models

The model should fit these terms simultaneously, and identify the independent effects of each process on the overall outcome.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Network ties are variable and network nodes are fixed;
  \item Assumptions about the form of local interactions (i.e., dependence) among tie variables are explicit;
  \item Regularities are represented by model parameters and estimated from data.
\end{itemize}

## Inferential SNA: Exponential-family random graph models

Say we see a friendship network in a classroom of size $n$.
\pause
\begin{itemize}
  \item Focus on structural characteristic of interest: are there more reciprocated ties than would be expected by chance?
  \item Posit a stochastic network model that includes a density parameter (ties occur at random) and a reciprocation parameter (tendency for reciprocation to occur).
  \item The probability distribution on the set of all possible graphs of size $n$ is constructed such that graphs with a lot of reciprocation are more probable.
  \item The MLE will be the parameter value such that the most probable degree of reciprocation is that which occurs in the observed network.
  \item Once we have estimated the parameters of the probability distribution, we can draw graphs at random and compare their characteristics with those of the observed network.
  \item If the model is good, then sampled graphs will resemble observed network; then we may hypothesize that the modeled structural effects could explain the emergence of the network.
\end{itemize}

## Inferential SNA: Exponential-family random graph models

\begin{itemize}
	\item Step 1: Treat each network as a random variable.
	\item Step 2: Propose hypothesis (or hypotheses) that define contingencies among tie variables.
	\item Step 3: Identify the specific form to the model based on your hypothesis (or hypotheses).
	\item Step 4: Simplify parameters for interpretations.
	\item Step 5: Estimate and interpret parameters.
	\item Step 6 (additional): Check goodness-of-fit and robustness.
\end{itemize}

## Inferential SNA: Homogeneous Bernoulli (Erdos-Renyi) models

Suppose $Y_{ij}$ in a graph are independent $\forall i,j$.
\begin{equation}
	\text{logit}[P(Y_{ij}=1 | X=x,\beta)] = \sum_k \beta_k X_{k,ij},
\end{equation}
given some covariates $X =\{X_1, \cdots, X_k\}$.

## Inferential SNA: Homogeneous Bernoulli (Erdos-Renyi) models

The log of the likelihood is
\begin{equation}
	\ell(\beta|Y,x) \equiv  \log[P(Y=y|X=x,\beta)],
\end{equation}
where $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$.

## Inferential SNA: Homogeneous Bernoulli (Erdos-Renyi) models

Say $Y_{ij}$ are independent and equally likely.
\begin{equation}
	P(Y_{ij}=1 | X=x,\beta) = \frac{\exp(\beta)}{1+\exp(\beta)} \quad \forall i,j.
\end{equation}
Equivalently,
\begin{equation}
	\log\text{odds}(Y_{ij}=1 | X=x,\beta) = \beta \quad \forall i,j.
\end{equation}
\pause
Our goal is to find $\hat{\beta}$ that maximizes the log-likelihood function $\ell(\beta|Y,x)$.

## Inferential SNA: French financial elite network (Kadushin 1995, AJS)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Each node is a member of french financial elite ($n=28$).
	\item Each edge represents who-to-whom responses to questions about "who are your friends."
	\item The dataset also recorded other node-level attributes.
\end{itemize}

## Inferential SNA: French financial elite network (Kadushin 1995, AJS)}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figs/ergm}
\end{figure}

## Inferential SNA: French financial elite network (Kadushin 1995, AJS)}

\begin{frame}
How do we interpret the coefficient? Recall
\begin{equation}
	P(Y_{ij}=1 | X=x,\beta) = \frac{\exp(\beta)}{1+\exp(\beta)} \quad \forall i,j.
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
	P(Y_{ij}=1 | \hat{\beta}) = \frac{\exp(\hat{\beta})}{1+\exp(\hat{\beta})}=0.1746032.
\end{equation}
What does this number mean?

## Examples of SNA research

\begin{itemize}
  \item State-building (e.g., Acemoglu et al 2015 AER)
	\item Regime change (e.g., Linos 2011 AJPS; Naidu et al 2015 WP)
	\item Information diffusion (e.g., Larson and Lewis 2017 APSR)
	\item Voting and electoral accountability (e.g., Arias et al 2017 WP; Cruz et al 2017 AER)
	\item Legislative behaviors and coalition politics (e.g., Bratton and Rouse 2011 LSQ)
	\item Collective action and protests (e.g., Siegel 2011 JOP)
	\item ... and more
\end{itemize}

## Some practical guide

\begin{itemize}
	\item Reflect on your area(s) of substantive interest.
	\item Pick a particular structure/phenomenon/pattern of ``relations.''
	  \begin{itemize}
	  \item What would the nodes represent?
	  \item What would the edges represent?
	  \item Should you use an undirected or a directed network?
	  \item Should you use a weighted or binary network?
	  \item Should you use an unipartite or bipartite?
	  \end{itemize}
	\item Describe how it might be represented using networks.
	\item Reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of your chosen representation.
\end{itemize}
