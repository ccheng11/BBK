## Motivation

\begin{itemize}
  \item Why network?
  \item What is a network?
  \item How do we study a network?
\end{itemize}

## Why network?

\begin{itemize}
  \item What explains different varieties of social, political, and economic outcomes?
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \item Conventional approaches focus on the traits of individual observations.
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \item The outcomes can be a function of individual's ties with others as well as many features of the networks that individuals belong to.
\end{itemize}

## Network science as a field

\begin{itemize}
  \item Theory: Math, physics, and computer science.
  \item Application:
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \begin{itemize}
		\item Engineering (e.g., power grid and signal exchanges)
    \item Natural and life sciences (e.g., disease transmission; yeast Interactome among proteins)
		\item Humanities and social sciences (e.g., market transactions and financial exchanges; friendships; mutual trust; ideas and texts)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.1cm}

## What is a network?

\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{network} (\textbf{graph}) is a composed of a set of objects, called \textbf{nodes} (or \textbf{vertices}), with some or all pairs of these objects connected by \textbf{ties} (\textbf{edges}).
	\item Two nodes are \textbf{neighbors} if they are connected.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \text{vertices} & = \{A,B,C,D,E\}\\
  \text{edges} & = (\{A,B\},\{A,C\},\{B,C\},\{C,E\})
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

## Basic types of networks (graphs)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Simple graph
  \item Weighted graph
  \item Directed graph
  \item Signed graph
\end{itemize}

## Basic types of networks: Simple graph

A network that has neither self-edges nor multiedges. That is, in addition to the definition above,
\begin{equation}
  A_{ii} = 0 \quad \forall \quad i.
\end{equation}

## Math representation of networks

The \textbf{adjacency matrix} or \textbf{sociomatrix} \textbf{A} of a graph (network) can be represented as an $n\times n$ matrix \textbf{A} such that
\begin{equation}
	A_{ij} =
	\begin{cases}
	1 & \text{if there exists an edge between $i$ and $j$}\\
	0 & \text{otherwise},
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $n$ refers to the number of \textbf{nodes}.

  3: \{2,4,5,6\}\\
  4: \{2,3\}\\
  5: \{1,3\}\\
  6: \{3\}\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

## Basic types of networks: Weighted graph

The adjacency matrix or sociomatrix \textbf{A} of a weighted network is an $n\times n$ matrix with elements
\begin{equation}
	A_{ij} =
	\begin{cases}
	r \in \mathbb{R} & \text{if there exists an edge between $i$ and $j$}\\
	0 & \text{otherwise},
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $n$ refers to the number of \textbf{nodes}.

## Basic types of networks: Directed graph

A directed network is a network in which edges have a direction, pointing from one vertex to another. The adjacency matrix \textbf{A} of a \textit{directed} graph is the matrix with elements
\begin{equation}
	A_{ij} =
	\begin{cases}
	1 & \text{if there exists an edge from $j$ and $i$}\\
	0 & \text{otherwise},
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $n$ refers to the number of \textbf{nodes}.

  \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
in which columns and rows refer to the starting and ending nodes respectively. 

## More types of networks

\begin{itemize}
  \item Affiliation network (bipartite network and hypergraph);
  \begin{itemize}
  \item cocitation network (i.e., studies that are cited together in a study)
	\item bibliographic coupling network (i.e., studies that use the same references)
  \end{itemize}
	\item regular network (i.e., networks in which all nodes have the same degree);
	\item planar network (i.e., networks that can be visualized without any edges crossing each other);		
	\item tree and forest;
  \item ... and many more.
\end{itemize}

## Affiliation network

\begin{itemize}
  \item A \textbf{bipartite graph} is a graph in which there are two types of node, and edges only run between the two types.
  \item A \textbf{hypergraph} is a network in which edges can join two or more nodes.
\end{itemize}

## Two pillars of social network analysis (SNA)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Descriptive SNA: Study numerical summary measures of networks.
  \vspace{0.1cm}
  \item Generative or inferential SNA: Study underlying dynamic process of network formation; hypothesis testing; simulation; Ergm.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA

\begin{itemize}
  \item Network connectivity;
  \begin{itemize}
	  \item degree
	  \item density
	  \item path and geodesic distance
	\end{itemize}
	\item node centrality: Measures of node importance in a network;
	\item ... and many more (e.g., cosine similarity, cliques, triads, and assortive mixing)
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Degree

Given an adjacency matrix \textbf{A}, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.
\begin{equation}
	k_i  = \sum_j^n A_{ij},
\end{equation}
where $n$ refers to the number of nodes in the graph.

## Descriptive SNA: Degree

A \textbf{regular} graph is one in which all nodes have the same degree.
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Figs/reg}
\end{figure}

## Descriptive SNA: Degree

The total number of edges, $m$, in graph \textbf{A} will be
\begin{equation}
  2m = \sum_i^n k_i \quad \Rightarrow \quad m = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i^n k_i,
\end{equation}
where $k_i$ is the degree of node $i$ in the graph.

## Descriptive SNA: Degree

How do we derive the mean degree of graph \textbf{A}?
\begin{equation}
  c = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n k_i = \frac{2m}{n}.
\end{equation}

## Descriptive SNA: Density

\begin{itemize}
  \item The density of a graph measures the \textit{connectance} of a graph.
  \vspace{0.2cm}
	\item Mathematically, it is defined as the number of edges out of the max possible number of edges of a graph.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Density

The density of a graph is defined as the share of the number of edges out of the max possible number of edges of a graph.
<!-- \pause -->
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{m}{\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} = \frac{c}{n-1},
\end{equation}
Recall that $c = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n k_i = \frac{2m}{n}$, where $c$ is the mean degree.

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

\begin{itemize}
		\item A \textbf{path} is a sequence of nodes with the property that each consecutive pair in the sequence is connected by an edge.
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		\item A \textbf{simple path} is a sequence of nodes with the property that each consecutive pair in the sequence is connected by an edge and each node in the sequence appears only once.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

\begin{itemize}
  \item In statistics, a path is also a \textbf{walk}.
  \item A \textbf{walk} of length $k$ between nodes $i$ and $j$ means that the path between $i$ and $j$ contains $k$ edges where $i\neq j$.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

\begin{itemize}
	\item Existence of \textit{walks} between nodes tell us about network connectivity.
	\item Existence of \textit{walks of minimal length} tells us about \textbf{geodesics}, or geodesic distance, between two nodes in the graph.
\end{itemize}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

The walks of all lengths between a pair of nodes can be counted using matrix multiplication. Define $W = A^k$, where $k$ means we multiply the adjacency matrix of graph \textbf{A} for $k$ times, then 
\begin{equation}
	W_{ij} = \text{the number of walks of length $k$ between $i$ and $j$.}	
\end{equation}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figs/path}
\end{figure}

## Descriptive SNA: Path, walk, and distance

Altogether, we can define $d_{ij}$, the geodesic distance between $i$ and $j$, as follows. Recall a path is a walk.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	d_{ij} & = \text{length of the shortest path between $i$ and $j$} \\
	& = \text{length of the shortest walk between $i$ and $j$} \\
	& = \text{the first or min $k$ for which $A_{ij}^{k}>0$}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

Centrality measures the \textit{importance} of each node in a network.

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

\textbf{Degree} centrality uses the degree of a vertex (i.e., the number of neighbors it has) to measure its importance in a graph.
\begin{equation}
	k_i = \sum_j^n A_{ij},
\end{equation}
where $n$ refers to the number of nodes in the graph.\
\vspace{0.3cm}
What is the caveat of degree centrality?

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

\textbf{Eigenvector} centrality measures the influence of a node in a network by giving each vertex a score \textbf{proportional} to the sum of the scores of its neighbors.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	& x_i = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_j A_{ij}x_j \\
	\Rightarrow \quad & \textbf{Ax} = \lambda\textbf{x},
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the leading eigenvector of \textbf{A}.\
\vspace{0.3cm}
Why do we need eigenvector centrality?

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

\textbf{Closeness} centrality measures the importance of a node by calculating the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph.
\begin{equation}
	c_i = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{n} \sum_j d_{ij}} = \frac{n}{\sum_j d_{ij}},
\end{equation}
where $d_{ij}$ is the geodesic distance between $i$ and $j$.\
\vspace{0.3cm}
Use $n$ or $n-1$?  Should we consider the situation such that $i=j$?

## Descriptive SNA: Centrality

\textbf{Betweenness} centrality measures the importance of a node by considering how often a node sits on the paths between all other nodes in the graph.
\begin{equation}
	x_i = \sum \frac{\sigma_{ijk}}{\sigma_{jk}},
\end{equation}
where $i\neq j\neq k$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\sigma_{jk}$ refers to the number of shortest paths from $j$ to $k$.
	\item $\sigma_{ijk}$ refers to the number of those paths that pass through $i$.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.3cm}
Normalization?

## Generative SNA

We hope to specify a stochastic model to
\begin{itemize}
  \item understand the underlying dynamic social and interactive processes (e.g., assortative mixing) associated with the observed outcomes;
  \item test hypotheses based on different varieties of node and structural attributes;
  \item extrapolate and simulate from the specified model.
\end{itemize}

## Generative SNA

For example: "clustering" typically observed in social nets can be a result of
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sociality: highly active persons create clusters.
  \item Homophily: assortative mixing by attribute creates clusters.
  \item Transitive triad closure: triangles create clusters.
\end{itemize}

## Generative SNA: Homogeneous Bernoulli (Erdos-Renyi) models

Suppose $Y_{ij}$ in a graph are independent $\forall i,j$.
\begin{equation}
	\text{logit}[P(Y_{ij}=1 | X=x,\beta)] = \sum_k \beta_k X_{k,ij},
\end{equation}
given some covariates $X =\{X_1, \cdots, X_k\}$.

## Generative SNA: Homogeneous Bernoulli (Erdos-Renyi) models

The log of the likelihood is
\begin{equation}
	\ell(\beta|Y,x) \equiv  \log[P(Y=y|X=x,\beta)],
\end{equation}
where $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$.

## Generative SNA: Homogeneous Bernoulli (Erdos-Renyi) models

Say $Y_{ij}$ are independent and equally likely.
\begin{equation}
	P(Y_{ij}=1 | X=x,\beta) = \frac{\exp(\beta)}{1+\exp(\beta)} \quad \forall i,j.
\end{equation}
Equivalently,
\begin{equation}
	\log\text{odds}(Y_{ij}=1 | X=x,\beta) = \beta \quad \forall i,j.
\end{equation}
Our goal is to find $\hat{\beta}$ that maximizes the log-likelihood function $\ell(\beta|Y,x)$.

## Example: French financial elite network (Kadushin 1995, AJS)

\begin{itemize}
	\item Each node is a member of french financial elite ($n=28$).
	\item Each edge represents who-to-whom responses to questions about "who are your friends."
	\item The dataset also recorded other node-level attributes.
\end{itemize}

## Example: French financial elite network (Kadushin 1995, AJS)

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figs/ergm}
\end{figure}

## Inferential SNA: French financial elite network (Kadushin 1995, AJS)

How do we interpret the coefficient? Recall
\begin{equation}
	P(Y_{ij}=1 | X=x,\beta) = \frac{\exp(\beta)}{1+\exp(\beta)}.
\end{equation}
Now given that $\hat{\beta}=-1.5533$,
\begin{equation}
	P(Y_{ij}=1 | \hat{\beta}) = \frac{\exp(\hat{\beta})}{1+\exp(\hat{\beta})}=0.1746032.
\end{equation}
What does this number mean?

## Some practical guide

\begin{itemize}
	\item Reflect on your area(s) of substantive interest.
	\item Pick a particular structure/phenomenon/pattern of ``relations.''
	  \begin{itemize}
	  \item What would the nodes represent?
	  \item What would the edges represent?
	  \item Should you use an undirected or a directed network?
	  \item Should you use a weighted or binary network?
	  \item Should you use an unipartite or bipartite?
	  \end{itemize}
	\item Describe how it might be represented using networks.
	\item Reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of your chosen representation.
\end{itemize}
