Leveraging AI in Social Science Research: From Theory to Practice

This four-session intensive course, organized over one or two weekends, introduces both qualitative and quantitative social researchers to the applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in their research workflows. Participants will develop critical competencies in utilizing AI tools across the research lifecycle, from literature review and research design to data analysis. The course is designed for researchers with or without coding experience, requiring only a willingness to engage with technical content.

Through a combination of theoretical frameworks and hands-on exercises using contemporary LLM platforms such as ChatGPT and Claude, participants will explore how AI can enhance research productivity while addressing critical considerations of bias, environmental impact, and intellectual property rights. The curriculum emphasizes practical applications within social and political science contexts, with special attention to text analysis methodologies.

Throughout the course, participants will engage with real-world research scenarios drawn from recent political and social research, practicing the implementation of GenAI tools to expedite data collection, assist with statistical programming tasks, and enhance analytical capabilities while maintaining research integrity.

By the conclusion of this module, researchers will possess actionable skills for responsibly incorporating AI into their established research practices, equipped with practical techniques to maximize research productivity while upholding academic rigor and methodological transparency.
